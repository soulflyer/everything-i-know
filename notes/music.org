Might not be necessary to clone from source. I found the scripts in /usr/libexec/mpdev 
Copied sticker.db and stats.db from *Acceptance* to *Transcendence* Next try reading them
Abandon *mpdev* in favour of *mppopd* which uses only stickers so I don't need 2 dbs
** DONE [#B] Look for a VCV soundfont player

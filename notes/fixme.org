It has to be run twice before all versions are created. The first one fails, possibly because the directories don't exist. Or possibly the check that the file is newer only works when there is a file there to compare it to. 
It wasn't broken, I was using the wrong incantation.

On subversion the search starts with anything previously typed on the line before hitting C-r. Why not on acceptance too?
Because acceptance is using /bin/bash which is hopelessly out of date. Added /opt/homebre/bin/bash to /etc/shells and did:
#+begin_src shell
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
#+end_src

 See note §2109271033
 This is probably related to getting *undo-tree* to display next to the file rather than below. Org appears to be doing the same thing. The problem only appears in wider windows. In narrow windows the org buffer appears below the main one and that is ok.

Based on ! in dired
Try something like:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (shell-command "<insert command here>"(buffer-file-name))
#+end_src
Or perhaps just make this specific to nv-zd
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (defun iw-nv-zd ()
     (interactive)
     (let ((command (format "nv-zd '%s'" (buffer-file-name))))
       (zetteldeft-find-file (shell-command-to-string command))
       (deft-refresh)))
#+end_src
This is not passing the file name to nv-zd. Hmmm. (FIXED with format)

This should help: [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/68839/2666][stack exchange link]] (it did)

Doesn't display output in minibuffer. (FIXED Use shell-command-to-string instead of shell-command)

F5 searches through a project for the string at point. If it is a separate word, it will find it. Great for re-frame subscriptions etc, but not good for things that are part of a path like *components/button-set* Can probably get emacs to split up the word at point if it contains a */* and just search for the last component
Not necessary, just select it first. F5 will search for a selection.

 
Talk to each of the teachers and find out some things about them.

For example:
What do you do in your free time?
Where are you from?
Do you like sports?
What was your favorite subject at school?
etc....

When you have talked to them they will give you a password. 
The password is different for every student so don't copy someone elses.
Record the passwords here:

|---------+-------------------|
| Teacher | Password -------- |

** DONE [#G] Store *VCV Patches* alongside an org-mode file
CLOSED: [2025-12-21 Sun 23:47]
Should display screenshot and open *VCV* with the vcv patch file when clicked.
Could use a *file:* link if I set things up to open *VCV Rack* when clicking on a *.vcvs* file. Alternatively use a *shell:* link.

** DONE [#G] Fix Sixpence None the Richer in EMMS
CLOSED: [2025-10-27 Mon 00:39]
can't play any sixpence none the righer via *EMMS*. Works ok in *mpd* so its something wrong in *EMMS*, possibly to do with the paths.
Error message is complaining about *Sister, Mother* which has a *comma* in the name. The listing in emms also shows duplicate tracks. These don't appear in *Euphonica* mpd client.

This is a completion package that will find results even if the pieces are given out of order
** DONE [#E] Investigate org-modern
CLOSED: [2025-10-07 Tue 01:45]
org-pretty-table mode doesn't handle table.el tables afaik. Also it's not being updated. Looks like org-modern can replace it and org-superstar
** DONE [#B] Rewrite emms additions (playcount left to do)
CLOSED: [2025-11-06 Thu 20:19]
Don't want to have a customised version of *emms* so add the changes I made to the emms source to emacs startup file
** TODO [#G] Make Emacs windows appear in the right place
Currently this mostly works, but by making assumptions about what is currently in a particular window. ie hit return on a task the agenda window should open the relevant agenda file in the left hand window. It does this now by re-using org buffers so it breaks if I happen to have dired open in the left window.
** DONE [#G] Add fn to import music
CLOSED: [2025-11-09 Sun 22:59]
Should:
- call mpc import to add tracks to mpd
- call convert to create small versions of cover.jpg
- call emms-cahe-set-from-mpd-directory
- maybe something for mpdev too

** DONE [#G] Add a play-count option to emms-browser-format-line
CLOSED: [2025-11-07 Fri 10:24]
In emms-browser.el, line 1749

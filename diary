Aug 7,  2020 Started cutting pieces for wheel arches in toolbox.
Aug 8,  2020 More stock prep for toolbox wheel arches. All pieces ripped out and face side and edge prepped. Hit a nail thicknessing. Resharpened and completed dirt removal but not all the thicknessing.
Aug 9,  2020 Reground jack plane iron to remove nicks from yesterdays nail hit. It now has a slight camber in the grind. Finished thicknessing and cut all the tails in one go. Used new Stanley crosscut, works well but is a bit coarse for dovetails. Cut and fitted the first 2 sets of pins.
Aug 10, 2020 Cut the remaining 2 sets of pins for the wheel arches. Cut the first 2 sliding dovetail housings in the front panel of the toolbox. Not sure if this is the best way to do this but it should work ok doing the female part first. Arches can then be fitted and slid into place after the main carcass is assembled.

Created a style with 2 Contrast-Brightness-Saturation modules with different parametric masks and a levels module to remove the shadows without losing text.
Aug 20, 2020 Darktable crashing regularly but usually stays up long enough to apply the style to a bunch of pages. building the new document in libreoffice. Up to pg 270 now.
Aug 21, 2020 Cleaned up some of the dovetails on the tool-chest.
Aug 22, 2020 Finished cleanup and recessed the wheel axle nuts and washers.

Aug 27, 2020 Made a thicker spacing piece for the kerfing plane and adjusted the holes in the body. It will now do more than 3 inches.
Aug 28, 2020 Cut One piece for one long and one short lower edge of the tool-chest. Bowsaw is blunt, not cutting any faster than the baby rip. Resharpened bowsaw and kerfing plane. Added a little set to the kerfing plane. May need a tiny bit more, its still prone to stick.
Aug 29, 2020 Cut the other pieces for the lower skirt of the toolchest. Added a bit more set to the kerfing plane. Seems about right. Still has some tendency to stick, but not as bad. I suspect it could do with smaller teeth.
Aug 30, 2020 Cleaned up all 4 pieces of the lower skirt. Scrub plane works beautifully just before it stops working altogether because it is too blunt. Seems that the clearance wears off so it cuts like a spokeshave leaving a really good surface. 10 mins later and it won't cut at all, so resharpen it and its back to being it's usual vicious bastard self, leaving tearout.
Sep 1,  2020 Squared up the pieces for the lower skirt of the toolchest.
Sep 3,  2020 Marked and cut and rough fitted the first skirt dovetail
Sep 4,  2020 Finished fitting the 1st dovetail and started marking the second. Resharpened some chisels. 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 are pretty much flattened, 5/8 and 1 still very slightly convex, probably from being flattened on a non flat stone.
Sep 5,  2020 Sharpened the tenon saw, used Nham's magnifier lamp. Made a new handle for her suitcase.
Sep 6,  2020 Completed dovetails for skirt and prepared for glue up.
Sep 7,  2020 Glued up lower skirt.
Sep 8,  2020 There are some gaps along the upper edge of the lower skirt. Should have checked more carefully, not easily visible with the carcass upside down. Used the failed veneer saw experiment to clean out and widen the gaps ready for a strip of wood to fill them.
Sep 10, 2020 Trying out lid designs
Sep 11, 2020 Marked out pieces for toolchest lid. Started sewing joints book
Sep 12, 2020 Finished sewing joints book. Glued and cut it.
Sep 14, 2020 Started cutting stock for lid pieces.
Oct 5,  2020 Completed preparing pdf for Holtzapffel 4. Involved getting rid of the shadows using darktable, but this doesn't like the jpegs extracted from the original pdf and crashes regularly. Used aperture to crop and straighten and then darktable to process the pages to remove the shadow. Only doing a few at a time seemed to help but the crashes were unpredictable. Re-assembled the pages using open-office. Sadly this will not print out signatures except by chopping the document into 16 page documents, so.... Export as pdf and use acrobat to print the signatures.
Oct 6,  2020 Printed out H5
Oct 7,  2020 Sewed H5

Nov 5,  2020 Fitted centre pieces of toolchest lid.
Nov 6,  2020 Cut 2 small crosspieces of toolchest lid, incl tenons and rebates.
Nov 7,  2020 Marked out mortices for small crosspieces. Improved the fitting of the main joints.
Nov 8,  2020 Cut mortices. Got mixed up and ended up with one on the wrong side (fixed by turning the upright around and refitting the joints) and off by an inch on the other one. Glued up the 4 centre joints.
Nov 9,  2020 Glued up remaining pieces of toolchest lid frame.
Nov 11, 2020 Prepared stock for lid hinge edge.
Nov 16, 2020 Made a scratchstock.
Nov 18, 2020 Made 1/2in concave and convex blade for scratchstock. Made a sample hinge joint to check it works ok for the toolchest.
Nov 21, 2020 After much thinking decided to go with plan A. A simpler, hinge on the outside, design would leave a gap that would be difficult to clear and not provide support to the open lid. Started to cut the rebate in the back piece for the lid edge. Made a base for the large router so its easier to use when there is only a small area to support the base.
Nov 23, 2020 Sanded and oiled the router base.
Nov 24, 2020 Cut recesses for the hinges in lid edge piece.
Nov 25, 2020 First fit of hinged lid piece.
Nov 26, 2020 Fixed edge to lid.
Nov 27, 2020 Resawed some pieces for lid edge. Possibly not hard wearing enough. Maybe use some Dao instead.
Nov 28, 2020 Spent some time trying to find suitable pieces for the lid edge. Probably overthinking this as they will mostly be painted. Would be nice to have the unpainted/worn bits showing dark brown though.
Nov 30, 2020 Flood warnings. Lifted the toolchest shell onto the bench just in case.
Dec 1,  2020 Power out, and still raining. Eased off later so I brought the sawhorse into the front doorway and worked on the owl netsuke.
Dec 2,  2020 Cleaned out the workshop and lifted everything back off the bench. Cut some Dao for the toolchest lid edge. Sharpened the bowsaw first. had trouble keeping the saw cutting straight. Maybe I'm pushing it too hard.
Dec 3,  2020 Prepared the rest of the stock for the toolchest lid edge. Cut and fitted the first dovetail. Made a spring steel probe tool handle. A row of slightly oversize holes and a pointed end to the spring steel driven in worked quite well.
Dec 4,  2020 Cut and fitted second dovetail for toolchest lid edge.
Dec 5,  2020 Trimmed width of toolchest lid so its a reasonably close (not tight) fit.
Dec 6,  2020 Trimmed Graph Database book.
Dec 7,  2020 Cut last 2 dovetails for the toolchest lid edge. Almost ready to glue it on.
Dec 8,  2020 Glued hinge piece to toolchest lid.
Dec 9,  2020 Made some more button clamps and glued on the rest of the toolchest lid edge.
Dec 10, 2020 Roughly cleaned up the top surface of the chest lid. Got 5 planes to sharpen before completing this.
Dec 11, 2020 Planes all sharpened. Problem with the big try plane would seem to be due to a hogback effect on the blade from sharpening it from both sides. Solution seems to be to use the coarse stone to flatten it with the blade at right angles to the stone. It's now closer to being flat, but still a little way to go. (Caution doing this. All too easy to slice the heel of the palm) Smoothing plane has similar symptoms (corners not touching the stone), but in this case it's likely to be the result of a seriously cupped sharpening stone at some time in the past. Finished flattening the toolchest lid.
Dec 12, 2020 Sewed FORTH book, except for about 3in of the last signature...
Dec 13, 2020 Glued and cut FORTH book
Dec 14, 2020 Mostly just trying to figure out which pieces of wood I can use for the remainder of the chest. Decided on drawer sizes. The lower ones for the flute reamers and the metalwork tools can be shallower than I thought, so 4 drawers will be ok.
Dec 15, 2020 Made the hinge support piece, and the front lip. Attached the rear lip/hinge support using countersunk screws that will eventually be hidden by plugs. Cut my right thumb web when marking the end of the back lip. More than just a scratch, thought it might need stitches, but the bleeding stopped fairly quickly. Cleaned it and used a drop of superglue to hold it together.
Dec 16, 2020 Hand seems to be doing ok. Cleaned up the back surface and flattened it a bit so the back lip sits flat. Cut the 2 edge lip pieces.
Dec 17, 2020 Cut and fitted 2 dovetails and glued on the back lip edge piece.
Dec 18, 2020 Cut and fitted remaining dovetails for the lip. Split and repaired one end of the front piece. Broke under its own weight. Repaired with white glue.
Dec 19, 2020 Decided to use pins to accurately position the front piece. Managed to split the other end of the front piece. Repaired it while gluing the front piece to the chest.
Dec 20, 2020 Added the side pieces. Lid edging now all in place.
Dec 21, 2020 Started cleanup of lid. Also trying to figure out what to do next, looks like lots of resawing.
Dec 23, 2020 Started to make panel gauge. Messed up a bit, cut the recess level with the top side of the beam instead of the bottom, and forgot I had planned to make the beam 1-1/2 wide and cut it 1-1/4.
Dec 24, 2020 Fixed both problems and completed gauge for use with a pencil.
Dec 25, 2020 Made blade and wedge for the panel gauge.
Dec 26, 2020 Started to finish one of the bottom planks. Lovely crotch figure.
Dec 27, 2020 Completed finishing crotch figure bottom board. Prepped some stock for Pen to make a little table.
Dec 28, 2020 Fitted half of the bottom planks.
Dec 29, 2020 Fitted rest of the bottom planks except for the narrow end piece.
Dec 30, 2020 Resawed a piece of that wood with the intense yellow colour on the border between the sap and heart woods. Fitted it and scrubbed the bottom of the chest. Turned it back over.
Dec 31, 2020 Cut and rough fitted the first 2 lid panels.
Jan 2,  2021 Cut and rough fitted the next lid panel, Cut the last one and repaired the crack all the way along it.
Jan 3,  2021 Rough fitted last panel. Flattened their backs.
Jan 4,  2021 Fettled dad's No4 Record. Straightened and squared the front of the mouth, flattened the sole and rounded the edge of the casting where my left hand rubs. Also gave it a good clean using some vinegar, rinsed off and then oiled.
Jan 5,  2021 Cut the internal fielding on the small panels
Jan 6,  2021 Started to cut the external fielding.
Jan 7,  2021 Finished the grooves delineating the external fielding. Cut the slope on all the long edges. Back twinge so I switched from using the rebate plane to using the carpenters gouge to rough out the slopes. Cleaned up with the rebate plane. Still need to do the short edge slopes and finish off with the shoulder plane.
Jan 8,  2021 Finished off external fielding. Started making the beading. Fitted beading for 1 and a half panels.
Jan 9,  2021 Re-did beading on second panel, sizes didn't match well.
Jan 10, 2021 Finished off the beading on the 4 panels, including reducing the height of the first 2 so they are all approximately level with the surface.
Jan 11, 2021 Cut sections for the centre panel. Started to scrub them to establish the inner surface.
Jan 12, 2021 More stock preparation for centre panel.
Jan 13, 2021 Jointed and glued up centre panel.
Jan 14, 2021 Worked inner fielding and roughed out outer fielding the same width as the small panels. Bottom edge lines up, but it doesn't look right. Will need to make it wider.
Jan 15, 2021 Bit of work on the fielding, not much today though.
Jan 16, 2021 3 edges of the fielding roughly finished. Mended a small split in the fielding edge.
Jan 17, 2021 Finished off the fielding and started considering how to ensure the lid can't drop accidentally. So far it has not shown any signs of doing that but it is really heavy. Probably going to go with a loose block that locates using sawn off woodscrews.
Jan 18, 2021 Made the beading to hold the centre panel.
Jan 19, 2021 Started making the block to secure the lid open. Also bought a 30kg vice and some old Japanese style plane irons from a scrappy in Dien Khanh
Jan 20, 2021 Cleaned and reassembled the old vice.
Jan 21, 2021 Flattened base for vice. Bought some rope for beckets (and a kitten)
Jan 22, 2021 Bought bolts and fitted the vice to its base.
Jan 23, 2021 Cut the curve on the lid block. High metal work vice is pretty useful for sawing small stuff like this. I like the odd design, it keeps the thread clean.
Jan 24, 2021 Cut groove for rope in the vice base. Spliced rope loop for vice carry handle.
Jan 25, 2021 Glued up the lid block. Doesn't work with just 1 screw. Will need one in the lid too.
Jan 26, 2021 Added second screw and cleaned up the lid block. It now effectively holds the lid open. Will need reinforcing plates to stop the screws wearing out the wood. I have a bit of broken hinge that will do nicely.
Jan 27, 2021 Started on coach-whipping the vice carry handle. Forgot how tough knotting can be on the fingers...
Jan 28, 2021 Completed coach-whipping and tried out a couple of turks heads. 5 bight 6 lead tripled in the small cord looks about right. 9 b 10 L tripled in 1/3 of the light cord is too small but makes a great finger protector.
Jan 29, 2021 Tied the turks heads and completed the vice carry handle. Looks great. Test turks head is now around my patchouli bottle.
Jan 30, 2021 Started to resaw thin planks for top drawer bottom: cut the kerf for the first plank. Also sharpened the kerfing plane and tried to figure out how to make it work without jamming. Sawdust is getting stuck in the kerf. Considering the possibility of using it horizontally so the sawdust has less tendency to fall back into the kerf. This would mean rebuilding it or using it left handed. Neither of these options is appealing. Wire brush does the job for now.
Jan 31, 2021 Sawed out the first plank. Tied a manrope knot as an experiment for the becket core.
Feb 1,  2021 Surfaced and cut the guide kerf for the next plank. Started tidying with a view to moving the office into the workshop.
Feb 2,  2021 Cut second plank.
Feb 5,  2021 Cut guide slot for 3rd plank
Feb 6,  2021 Cut 3rd plank and cat proofed the yard.
Feb 7,  2021 Cut 3 planks for the drawer fronts. Chamfered the edges of the kerfing saw fence. Resawing was done with the big ripsaw I made. Seems to be cutting pretty straight now after I took a tiny bit of set off the left hand side. Also being careful to only cut a triangle and then reverse the wood and cut from the other side helps. Even if the cut is wandering a little it won't ruin anything until the cut goes past the triangle.
Feb 8,  2021 Helped Pen make a tiny table.
Feb 9,  2021 Moved the table and computer into the workshop. Made a .020in pokey thing.
Feb 12, 2021 Tied crown sinnet handle for pliers (just one, keep the other until it splits) and handle for 025in pokey thing.
Feb 15, 2021 Measured and weighed the beams in the yard. Pretty dense stuff. One of them is heavier than water.
Feb 16, 2021 Started trying to flatten a piece of 2by4 to cut planks for drawer backs. Even the toothing plane is struggling...
Feb 17, 2021 Made 2 new tuning peg handles for baby spice. 2 more of the originals had broken. Also straightened out the jaw liners of the metal vice. Was going to try filing them flat, but bending did the job faster.
Feb 18, 2021 Cut the guide kerf for a piece for the back of a drawer. This stuff is hard.
Feb 19, 2021 Cut the plank. Took hours of hard work. This stuff is too good for a drawer back. Very dense and close grained.
Feb 20, 2021 Cut another plank using some bang-lang. got enough stock to make the top drawer now. Printed and sewed typescript book.
Feb 21, 2021 Put cover on typescript book, cut the edges.
Feb 25, 2021 Mostly trying to work out what to do about non parallel chest sides. It's close enough to work but I would rather not risk the top drawer jamming.
Feb 26, 2021 Cut tapered piece to line chest so drawer sides are parallel.
Feb 27, 2021 Finished second taper piece and glued them to the inside of the chest. Used up the last of the black glue, so cleaned the pot out. Made another tuning peg for baby spice and some metal plates for the chest lid support.
Mar 2,  2021 Marked out the dovetails for the top drawer.
Mar 4,  2021 Cut the dovetails for the top drawer. Started to mark out the pins.

Mar 16, 2021 resawed some more of the rayed wood for drawer bottoms.
Mar 17, 2021 Prepared left and right runners for trinket drawer. Ripped stock for chisel separators that go between them.

Mar 19, 2021 Cut the base for the trinket drawer to go on top of the chisels.
Mar 20, 2021 Prepared stock for trinket drawer sides.
Mar 21, 2021 Cut the pins for the trinket tray.
Mar 22, 2021 Cut and fitted 2 of the dovetail joints for the trinket tray.
Mar 23, 2021 Finished the dovetails and Glued up trinket tray. In too much of a hurry to clean it up and trim it to fit, loosened some of the joints and had to re-glue. Next time wait overnight. Trimming dovetails puts a lot of stress on a joint.
Mar 24, 2021 Final fitting of trinket tray. Oiled it and put it to use.
Mar 25, 2021 Cut a plank for the sides of the second toolchest drawer.
Mar 26, 2021 Cut front back and sides of 2nd drawer to length and thickness.

Apr 10, 2021 Print postgres-sql book, start work on the pignose.
Apr 11, 2021 start sewing psql book, got the pignose working. Needs a new switch mechanism, but works now by removing the battery to turn it off.
Apr 12, 2021 Completed psql book. First time the cover is to big to make out of one piece of A4. Went to buy some wood. Came back with maybe 1/4 m3, mostly looks like satinwood (lots of ripple) but some that is probably Lim.
Apr 13, 2021 Cleaned up some of the wood, removed bolts and nails.
Apr 14, 2021 Cleaned up the rest of the wood. Straightened out the crosscut saw I bought in Metro, removed the twist. Managed to cut straight with it for the first time, cutting a piece to use for the backs of drawers 3 and 4. Stuff I cut last week is a bit harder and heavier and the wrong colour.
Apr 15, 2021 Started to cut the kerf for the new plank for the back of drawer 3. Vice handle broke, repaired it again. Made a new front face bench stop thing.
Apr 16, 2021 Cut a bit more and the handle broke again. Fixed it with a strap round the outside this time. Hopefully will hold better. Cleaned up the bench stop thingy.
Apr 17, 2021 Completed the cut for the plank for the back of drawer 3. Nice and straight. Cut the kerf for the next plank.
Apr 18, 2021 Cut the kerf for a second plank.
Apr 19, 2021 Sawed the second plank. Much sweat.
Apr 20, 2021 Cut the kerf and sawed the 3rd plank. 3-3/4in x 46-1/2in. The saw cut took 1 hour and 50 mins, didn't time the kerf cut (1.6 in^2/min)
Apr 21, 2021 Cut another section from the same beam for use as drawer bottoms.
Apr 22, 2021 Cut the kerf and sawed a plank from a piece of Bang Lang, 3in x 35in. Sawing took 15mins (7 in^2/min), kerf? Not sure. 15mins including much faffing. that other stuff may not be Bang Lang. The colour is similar, but its harder and the grain is tighter and has less detail. Cut the kerf for another piece of it 3-7/8in x 22in, took 10 solid minutes. Started to saw it and spent 30 mins before siesta time stopped me. Managed about 80% of it.
Apr 23, 2021 Completed yesterdays cut, took another 9 mins (2.2 sqin/min). Cut the kerf (10mins ish) and sawed another plank. 31mins (2.75 sqin/min) It seems that part of the reason this wood is so slow is the saw sticks. Not enough to jam, but enough to support the weight of the saw and prevent it cutting to full efficiency. Waxing the teeth (not the sides of the blade) helps. Needs to be done every 20 or so strokes. With a bit of care it could be done without even breaking rhythm. Considering running melted wax into the kerf so it happens automatically.
Apr 24, 2021 Cut another plank. Tried rubbing wax into the kerf before sawing, but it didn't seem to help. Regular touch of wax on the backstroke of the saw did though.
Messed up the timing, not sure how long this plank took, but it definitely felt easier, if not actually faster. Started looking for some blade stock to make a new kerfing saw blade. Will use the offcut from the last one. It's too short (the original was cut down from a piece bought for the bowsaw which is slightly less than double the blade length of the kerfing saw) This hopefully wont make much difference.
Apr 25, 2021 No sawing today, but started cutting the teeth for the new kerfing saw blade. This one will have a less aggressive angle (12degrees instead of 0degrees) to see if that makes it easier to push. I will also give it a little more set when I get to that stage.
Apr 26, 2021 Completed the new blade for the kerfing saw.
Apr 27, 2021 New blade cuts a lot easier. I think it is because there is more set (possibly a little too much, the kerf is visible on the completed plank) I suspect the old blade will work ok, and be a little faster, just given a bit more set.
Apr 28, 2021 Cut 2 drawer bottom planks. Not actually much faster, but easier going. Using longer reps (100+) and no noticeable decrease in accuracy.
Apr 29, 2021 Sharpened jack and try planes, and prepared the surfaces of the pieces cut for the last 4 drawer bottom pieces. Sawed the 8th piece, still almost 30 mins (2.9 sqin/min)
Apr 30, 2021 Cut the last pieces for the drawer bottoms.
May 3,  2021 Made a bench-stop for use when resawing. Prepared stock for the lip of the top drawer.
May 4,  2021 Fitted the lip around the top drawer.
May 5,  2021 Cleaned up the top drawer and sanded and oiled it. Improved the small file rack.
May 6,  2021 Made a bench stop plate to help with using the cutting gauge to slice strips.
May 7,  2021 Cut strip for edge of second drawer.
May 8,  2021 Cut rebate and glued edge strip on second drawer.
May 9,  2021 Finished second drawer front. Not sure I like the protruding strip. May reduce it, or flatten it completely next time the drawer is out.
May 10, 2021 Prepped stock for the 3rd drawer, Face sides and thickness.
May 11, 2021 Cut stock for the 3rd drawer to width. Cut the tails for the 4 corner joints.
May 12, 2021 Cut and fitted the back 2 sets of dovetail joints. Started on one of the front ones, and prepped the stock for the muntin.
May 13, 2021 Fitted the remaining dovetails of the 3rd drawer. Cut the grooves for the bottom. Prepared and glued up the drawer bottoms
May 14, 2021 Power cut for almost the whole day, but I did manage to flatten the surface of the drawer bottoms.
May 15, 2021 Fitted the bottom panels and the muntin. Didn't glue it yet, I want to add the edging strip first. It should be easier before the drawer is assembled.
May 16, 2021 Added the edging strip. Was restrained and didn't try to glue the rest up.
May 17, 2021 Cleaned up the edging strip and glued up the 3rd drawer.
May 18, 2021 Cleaned up the 3rd drawer.
May 19, 2021 Cut first support for 3rd drawer. Put my back out cleaning up, just by standing up.
May 24, 2021 Cut a small square for drawing pentagrams.
May 25, 2021 Cut some more squares. Drawing pentagons and pentagrams is best done with both 18-72 and 36-54 degree squares.
May 29, 2021 Started on wrapping the cords for the first manrope knot.
May 30, 2021 Completed the first manrope knot for the chest beckets.
Jun 6,  2021 Forgot to complete this diary. Last few days have been occupied with knot tying, but not sure what happened when.
Jun 7,  2021 coachwhipping for the hand grip of the becket. Ouch.
Jun 8,  2021 Completed the coachwhipping on the first becket.
Jun 9,  2021 Added the turks heads to the first becket. 16 cords * 24in (12 per leg) plus one longer one for the odd leg and the spiral cord for the stems, 16? cords * 48 for the coachwhipping (24 per leg), 16ft single cord for the large turks heads, I think the small ones were 5ft.
Jun 10, 2021 Cut a piece for the becket block. Started to prep it.
Jun 11, 2021 Drilled the hole for the becket. Pilot hole on the drill press, then first 1/2in with the adjustable bit. Rest with the adjustable bit with the adjustable cutter removed. Tendency to jam, so cleared the sides regularly with the carpenters gouges. Also removed some of the waste with further use of the drill press, being careful to maintain the centre hole to guide and draw in the bit. Cut the leather sheath and sewed it. Also made the washers.
Jun 12, 2021 Finished shaping the becket block. Cut the denim wrapping for the final manrope knot and started sewing it on.
Jun 13, 2021 Completed the 1st becket.
Jun 14, 2021 Attached the becket to the chest.
Jun 15, 2021 Cut the second support for the 3rd drawer and started to fit it.
Jun 16, 2021 Made support blocks for the 3rd drawer support.
Jun 17, 2021 Finished fitting the drawer supports and oiled the first 3 drawers again.

Jun 23, 2021 Prepared stock for drawer ends. cut to thickness.
Jun 24, 2021 Cut the 2 drawer ends to size. Started marking out dovetails
Jun 25, 2021 Completed marking out the dovetails.
Jun 26, 2021 Sawed the dovetails for the last drawer. This is going slowly. If I counted right this takes the total number of dovetails in the toolchest up to 164.
Jun 27, 2021 Cleaned up all the tails for the 4 joints.
Jun 28, 2021 Marked out the pins. Also made a left handed marking knife.
Jun 29, 2021 Cut all the pins and fitted the 2 front joints.
Jun 30, 2021 Fitted the remaining joints.
Jul 1,  2021 Made the bottom panels for the 4th drawer.
Jul 2,  2021 Fitted all the panels for the 4th drawer.
Jul 3,  2021 Glued and assembled the 4th drawer.
Jul 4,  2021 Cleaned up the 4th drawer and adjusted the fit. Started to make the runners.
Jul 5,  2021 Abandoned the first attempt at runners. There isn't enough width in the 3rd drawer supports to securely attach the 4th drawer runners.
Jul 6,  2021 Completed one new runner.
Jul 7,  2021 Fitted the first of the new runners and made the second.
Jul 8,  2021 fitted the second runner.

Jul 17, 2021 Made and fitted the handles for the top drawer and started thinking about storage at the front of the chest for saws.
Jul 18, 2021 Started making holster for 2 small saws.
Jul 19, 2021 Fitted saw holster.
Jul 23, 2021 Made and fitted the piece for the front of the toolchest that supports the 2 squares and will guard the framesaw. Started to make a holster for the marking knife
Jul 24, 2021 Fitted the marking knife holster. Glued up the square support. added the lip, and screwed it in place.
Jul 25, 2021 Made the grooved piece for the big rip-saw till.

Jul 27, 2021 Made till for crosscut and rip saws.
Jul 28, 2021 Fitted till for crosscut and rip saws. Toolchest is now fully operational, although the panels are still loose in the lid and it is missing one of the beckets.
Jul 29, 2021 Planing lathe build.
Jul 30, 2021 Cut pieces for lathe bedways.
Jul 31, 2021 Sharpened one of the Japanese style plane irons from the scrapyard for a new high angle plane. Lathe bedways are too hard to easily work with the usual planes.
Aug 1,  2021 Started making new handle for my toothing plane. Fitted it, but not chamfered and rounded the grip yet.
Aug 2,  2021 Completed and fitted the new handle for the toothing plane. Marked out piece to cut for the new high angle plane body. Not the mouth etc, only the crosscut. Cutting it at a slight angle as the body will not run parallel to the original sides of the beam so it follows the grain better.
Aug 3,  2021 Cut the piece for the body of the high angle plane. Handle of toothing plane was coming loose whenever I removed the blade so I glued it in. Prepared the face side at some cost. This stuff is very hard.
Aug 5,  2021 Prepared face edge of high angle plane body. Toothing plane is working nicely and new handle is now secure. Marked out bed and mouth.
Aug 6,  2021 Drilled and rough cut the mouth of the high angle jack plane.
Aug 7,  2021 Cleaned up the mouth and rough fitted the blade with temporary wedges. Cuts very nicely, although it jams quickly because the  mouth still needs refinement.
Aug 8,  2021 Made the wedge and refined the mouth. Cuts very well and made short work of planing the offcut from its body.
Aug 9,  2021 Cut out the tote for the high angle jack plane, including sawing to thickness with the kerfing plane and big rip, plus drill and coping saw followed by spokeshave.
Aug 10, 2021 Shaped and fitted the tote, cleaned up the top surface of the high angle jack plane body.
Aug 11, 2021 Finished off the high angle jack plane. Added chamfers and cleaned up all the surfaces. glued in the handle. Sanded some more and oiled it.
Aug 12, 2021 Prepared the face side of one of the lathe bedways. Started to work on the face edge. New plane is working well although it still needs to be sharpened frequently. Pretty sure that is just because of the extreme hardness of the timber.
Aug 13, 2021 Bit more work on the face edge, but back was hurting so I didn't push it. Cleaned up the toothing plane handle, and oiled it, and the new plane (with Pony's help)
Aug 14, 2021 Nailed in the edging strips in the toolchest lid.
Aug 15, 2021 Drawing plans for the frame joints of the lathe.
Aug 16, 2021 Decided to use the opposite face of the lathe bedways as the face side to maximize the amount of the heart that gets kept. Started truing that up. Multiple sharpenings, lots of adjusting practice. I think the trick to dealing with ultra hard woods is being able to resharpen quickly and efficiently. Showed Pony how to feel for a burr when sharpening, and how to look along a plane to see the set, or a piece to see the curve..
Aug 17, 2021 Taking it easy today. Showed Pen how to mark out the stock for her dolls house bed.
Aug 18, 2021 Back to trying to prep the stock for the bedways of the lathe. 5 cuts and the plane loses its edge. About 20 and it wont cut any more. Got the new face side done and started on the edge. Using the toothing plane as well now. The edge lasts a bit longer but still not all that long.
Aug 19, 2021 Completed face edge and marked out the thickness. 1/8 - 3/16 to remove from one end. Not sure whether to use the kerfing-plane (or plough plane) followed by a large gouge or use the scrub plane. It probably doesn't warrant the adze.
Aug 20, 2021 Roughed the first bedway to thickness with the scrub plane. Cuts well into the sapwood, but struggles with the heartwood as expected. Finished it off with the toothing plane. Modified the toothing plane handle. It's not as pretty but seems more comfortable now.
Aug 22, 2021 Made and fitted supports for the T-square in the tool chest.
Aug 23, 2021 More work on the first bedway face side and edge. Pretty close now.
Aug 24, 2021 Started on the second bedway. Got the face side roughly flat and started on the face edge.
Aug 25, 2021 More work on the face edge. It was quite curved, needed to remove about 1/4inch. Used the adzes.
Aug 28, 2021 More work on the face side. There is still a slight twist but its close to done.
Aug 29, 2021 Started work on making Bergeron readable. The English translation only covers volume 1 so I'm attempting to translate the French using the fulltext from archive.org and google translate. This is going to take a while. The OCR is good but there is a lot of crap in there that needs to be removed and formatted sensibly. Using org to assist this.
Aug 31, 2021 More work on the face side and edge of the second lathe bedway. Face is close enough now, started cutting the kerf to saw it to width. Cut a new piece (1inch thick) for the kerfing saw so I can use it to cut the bedways to depth. Still need to finish it. Rearranged the bottom layer of the toolchest so the kerfing saw can be accessible, and put away when it is set to a large width. Now most of the planes run front to back and the kerfing plane lives in front of the carving tools box.
Sep 1,  2021 Finished the kerf and started sawing. Painfully slow and constantly sticking. Started sharpening the saw (big rip) and ended up reshaping the teeth to have a bit less of an aggressive angle.
Sep 2,  2021 Finished sharpening the saw and completed the cut. The saw didn't need resetting. Much easier when it's sharp. Not sure if the less aggressive angle has made much difference. I suspect the cut is slightly slower, but easier and more predictable. That's a combination of guesswork, wishful thinking, and maybe the tiniest bit of immeasurable feel. Whatever. It's working well, even in this extremely hard wood.
Sep 6,  2021 Sharpened both spokeshaves. Also managed to wear away my r.middle finger nail. I keep forgetting abrasives can do this...
Sep 8,  2021 More work on cleaning up the raw text for the Bergeron book.
Sep 14, 2021 Flattened the newly sawn face of the back bedway. This will be the final face side, and the internal edge of the bedway slot.
Sep 16, 2021 finished preparing the final face sides and edges for the bedways. Used the high angle jack.I can sharpen and set it a lot quicker now. Also getting in to the habit of sharpening it before putting it away. Makes starting off the next day much easier. Also started cutting the kerf for the depth cut on the back bedway. It's too close to the edge to saw but will serve as a guideline for using the scrub plane..
Sep 17, 2021 Started cutting the kerf for the depth cut on the front bedway. Hard going. The kerfing plane does a good job, but it often seems to be a bit of a fight. Maybe that is why there is no evidence of them being used historically. They can compensate for a lack of skill in rip sawing accurately, but maybe the best way is just to practice.
Sep 18, 2021 Cut the kerf a little deeper but not to full depth. The saw is way easier to use. Cut the excess off. Tried the high angle jack plane out on a 2in square section piece with wild grain. Very little tearout is visible. There is still some, but nothing that would cause a problem.
Sep 25, 2021 Planed the last edge of the bedways. Ready to start building the frame now.
Sep 28, 2021 Started to sort out stock for the lathe frame. Nothing cut yet, I need to decide if I should use the thicker piece for the 2 front uprights. There is just enough, but then it doesn't match at the bottom end, so it will need shaping. It's either that or have less thickness for the bedway Holtzapffel dovetail joints. Both options are possible.
Oct 1,  2021 Cut and started to prep the first upright.
Oct 2,  2021 Face side and face edge of the first upright done.
Oct 3,  2021 Prepared face side and edge of second front upright.
Oct 4,  2021 Started prep of first lower horizontal, Not good, worm damage. will need to redo.
Oct 6,  2021 Cut up some more beams for the lathe frame.
Oct 7,  2021 Rough prep of face and side of 1st back upright.
Oct 9,  2021 Finished face side and edge of first back upright.
Oct 11, 2021 Cut various pieces to length.
Oct 12, 2021 Prepped the first top piece and cut to length. Now have all the main pieces for one end frame and most of the other.
Oct 17, 2021 Lost track a bit. Slow work and missed days. At some point over the last few days, got the top right piece planed up on all four sides and 2 of the extra ½in pieces for the top of the front uprights sawn and surfaced.
Oct 19, 2021 Marked out and drilled the first mortice for the right hand frame of the lathe.
Oct 20, 2021 Cleaned up mortice slot in the front right upright, and the extra piece that goes on the back.
Oct 21, 2021 Made up a new batch of glue and glued the extra piece on the back of the right front upright.
Oct 25, 2021 cleaned up the edges of the glued on piece and cleaned up the mortice a bit. Slow today, feeling dizzy still.
Oct 28, 2021 Printed out Plumier (English translation) and started sewing it.
Oct 29, 2021 Finished sewing Plumier and glued it. Attempting to do it in one go this time. Turns out to be a mistake. Not easy to get the cover square and close fitting without gluing the book blank first.
Oct 30, 2021 Cut the edges of the Plumier book.
Nov 1,  2021 Cut the tenon on the top right horizontal. Replaced the rope work for one of the hammock chair bar supports. Tried to test it with the hook directly on the door frame beam. Schoolboy error.. Hook is strong enough when the strain is on the curve of the s as in normal use, but the point is much further out and the hook straightened out, dumping me on the floor. Bruised toe and a ding in my forehead where the hook hit me. Nhâm over-reacted as predicted (:-)
Nov 2,  2021 Finished the new ropework for the hammock chair bar. Chin-ups are hard now. Will take time to get back to the point where I can do 10 in a row.
Nov 9,  2021 Worked on fitting the first mortice and tenon joint of the lathe. Not quite there, slides in about half way.
Nov 11, 2021 Completed fitting the first M and T joint.
Nov 13, 2021 Started flattening the top surface of the right front upright of the lathe frame.
Nov 14, 2021 Finished flattening the top surface of the right upright and started marking it out for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 15, 2021 Roughed out the separator slot for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 17, 2021 Cleaned up the separator slot
Nov 18, 2021 Roughed out the first sloping face of the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 19, 2021 Roughed out the second sloping face for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 22, 2021 Made a shelf for the cookbooks. Used the broken handle from the toothing plane as a bookend.
Nov 25, 2021 made and rough fitted the separator piece for the first Holtzapffel dovetail. Not driven it all the way in yet, it would be hard to get it out again. Marked the ends of the bedways to match the joint.
Nov 26, 2021 Cut the ends of he bedways. Managed to saw fairly accurately, essential because this stuff is a pig to plane.
Nov 27, 2021 Planed the ends of the bedways. Started to plan making a chamfer/bullnose plane to help finish the matching surfaces.
Dec 11, 2021 Made a chisel plane.
Dec 11, 2021 Chisel plane is not much use on this wood. Reverted to chisel, scraper chisel and abrasive.
Dec 21, 2021 Prepped face side and edge of the second back upright.
Dec 22, 2021 Finished the second large cushion for the hammock chair. Should have done this years ago...
Dec 25, 2021 Bought a metal turning lathe, and started to clean it up. Dismantled the cross slide and reassembled it.
Dec 26, 2021 dismantled and reassembled the top slide. Recut some of the threads on the toolpost which have seen some abuse. The handwheel on the top slide had the wrong screw holding the wheel with the graduations in place. The threads are a different pitch from usual, so although the replacement screw was the correct size (6mm) it had messed up the threads. I redrilled it and cut a thread the next size up as I had an allen headed screw of the right size. The head was too wide so I used the lathe to turn it down to roughly match the original on the other handwheel. 2 different sized screws turned by the same allen key now. 
Dec 27, 2021 Finished cleaning up the threads in the toolpost. They are all ok now, although there aren't enough bolts for all of them. 2 of the tapped holes had pieces of broken bolt in them. The first came out yesterday, pushed by the tap (I didn't realise it was there) The second I drilled as close as I could get to the correct tapping size then cut the remains out with the tap. The taps I have are a cheap set but they seem to be holding up well. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the tap driver which appears to be made of cheese. Wish I could find the old tap driver I had. Simple square holes in a hardened steel bar are far more sensible than a fancy adjusting mechanism with left and right hand threads.
Dec 29, 2021 Drilled the mortice for the top back right joint of the lathe frame. Started cutting the matching tenon.
Dec 31, 2021 Cut the mortice to approximate size. Still a bit of cleanup on the crossgrain faces to do.
Jan 1,  2022 Cut the tenon for the top back right corner of the lathe frame. Also resharpened the stanley crosscut saw as a rip saw. Cuts very nicely, ideal for mid sized stuff.
Jan 3,  2022 Cut a piece for the guitar.
Jan 4,  2022 Further shaping of the guitar piece. Cut some brass tube for the spacers and fitted it. It's now playable.
Jan 7,  2022 Cut the haunch and fitted the back right mortice and tenon joint.
Jan 8,  2022 Refined the fitting of the 2 mortice and tenon joints
Jan 9,  2022 Sewed and glued SICP
Jan 10, 2022 Cut SICP. Biggest book yet.
Jan 12, 2022 More cleaning up of the top mortice and tenons for the right hand frame of the lathe. Now I can't get thin clock spring poker in between the parts of the joint on the outside face. There is a tiny bit on the inside that isn't completely closed yet, but that's probably ok. Marked out the bottom mortice and tenons.
Jan 15, 2022 Tailstock arrived, converted it to allen keys. Considering the best way to cut it to shorten it. Might be worth buying an end mill to use in the metal lathe. Might just file (scrape?) it.
Jan 17, 2022 Drilled mortices for the bottom of the lathe side frame.
Jan 19, 2022 Started to chop the mortices.
Feb 5,  2022 Rough fitted the floyd rose. Will need to take the top surface back, but it fits ok and seems to be reasonably well intonated with the old posts. Might not have to move them forwards but may still move them outwards a little.
Mar 19, 2022 Started cutting the front surface back so the floyd is level with it not recessed.
Mar 20, 2022 Plugged and re-drilled one of the bridge pivot holes. Did some more shaping, reducing the bulge behind the nut, the recess for the bridge and the heel.
Mar 21, 2022 More reshaping. Refined the heel some more. Restrung it to check how the bridge sits now.
Mar 22, 2022 Deepened the pickup recess to accommodate the reduction of depth caused by cutting back the front surface.
Mar 23, 2022 Glued a plug into the hole left for inserting the truss rod.
Mar 24, 2022 Made clearance for the trem and started sanding.
Mar 25, 2022 More sanding and oiled the body
Mar 26, 2022 Sanded the top bar, oiled, assembled and tested.
Mar 29, 2022 Cut the tenon at the bottom of the right front leg of the lathe. Reground Les's 78 to use on the tenon faces. Tried setting up the edge plane too. It's not as hard as I thought it would be. Also worked on the end grain faces of the mortice that matches the tenon.
Apr 1,  2022 Fitted the bottom front right joint and cut the haunch on the bottom back right tenon.
Apr 3,  2022 Made and fitted the locking nut for my guitar. Spent some time trying to get the strap length right. Tricky because of the offset strap button. If it's short enough to have a relaxed right arm then it tends to tilt the body, which makes it easier to see the fretboard but not good for the left wrist.
Apr 5,  2022 Fitted all 4 mortice and tenon joints, and assembled the right hand frame.
Apr 6,  2022 Refined the 4 joints so the shoulders all meet reasonably well.
Apr 7,  2022 Mostly thinking about how to do the motor mount and the groove for the backboard of the lathe.
Apr 8,  2022 Cut the groove in the top horizontal piece, and the curve on the front of the foot. Not going to glue it up just yet, probably better to get both sides made first. Retired the old rip saw. The widthwise bow is too much trouble. Put the handle on the new stanley crosscut sharpened as a rip. Resharpened all the new metric drills.
Apr 11, 2022 Cut a piece to make the extensions at the top of the lathe left leg.
Apr 12, 2022 Sharpened the high angle jack and the try plane and finished squaring off the front left upright. Continued with marking it out. The bottom tenon was already marked when figuring out how to avoid the holes in the piece.
Apr 13, 2022 Set up new camera mount on the window in to the workshop. Discovered I have an old tap that is the right size for a camera mounting bolt.
Apr 15, 2022 Trued up the extra piece, cut it to width and length and glued it on to the top of the leg.
Apr 16, 2022 Refined the face side (including the added piece) and face edge. Marked out the top mortice and adjusted the bottom tenon which was already marked, but too short. I had marked it as just long enough to clear the bolt hole, but it turns out there was more spare length at the top end. I can now leave the bottom piece at full width and add feet rather than cut it to shape if I choose.
Apr 18, 2022 Started truing up the horizontal piece. Videoed it, but didn't talk, just as a dry run. High angle plane is jamming. Going to try and sort that before the next take.
Apr 19, 2022 Finished truing up the top horizontal piece. Cut it to width and thickness. Did some fettling of the high angle plane. Still not quite right but getting better.
Apr 20, 2022 Marked out the horizontal piece and cut it to length. Drilled and chopped the mortice for the top left front joint of the frame.
Apr 21, 2022 Drilled and chopped the mortice for the top back left joint of the lathe frame.
Apr 22, 2022 Cleaned up the 2 mortices.
Apr 23, 2022 Marked and cut the tenons on the top left horizontal piece of the lathe frame.
Apr 24, 2022 Cleaned up both tenons
Apr 25, 2022 Cut the haunch on the front tenon and fitted the joint. Sharpened and set the infill shoulder plane. Really tricky to do, the end of the blade needs to be at exactly the right angle, which isn't exactly 90° as far as I can tell. Also there is a slight rounding on one side of the mouth that makes it look like it is wider on one side. That confuses the issue a bit. Best ignore how wide the mouth looks and just sight along the sole to see how much the blade protrudes.
Apr 26, 2022 Glued on the second extra piece of the front left lathe leg.
Apr 27, 2022 Cut the mortice for the lathe bed spacers and marked out all parts of the Holtzapffel dovetail joint. Opened up the mouth of the high angle jack plane a bit more, and cambered the iron a little. It seems to cut without clogging now.
Apr 28, 2022 Sharpened the tenon saw. Seems to be ok for set still. Not looking forward to having to set it. Cut the rest of the second Hotzapffel dovetail on the upright and marked out the matching ends on the bedways.
Apr 29, 2022 Cut the end of the bedways. Brought the drill press inside and mounted it on the bench. Started drilling the first lengthwise hole in one of the bedways.
Apr 30, 2022 Fixed the chuck on the non ratchet brace. One of the jaws had got badly twisted. Completed drilling the lengthwise holes in the bedways and took the drill press back outside again
May 1,  2022 Brought another length of wood in and cut it for the lower part of the left hand lathe frame. Washed it down to get rid of some of the dirt.
May 2,  2022 Trued up The piece I cut for the lower left lathe frame
May 3,  2022 Marked up the remaining joints for the left side lathe frame and drilled the 2 mortices. Started chopping out the front one.
May 4,  2022 Cleaned up the front mortice and started chopping the second. Also got the bike running again, adjusted the brakes and cleaned and oiled the chain.
May 5,  2022 Cut the tenons for the last 2 joints
May 6,  2022 Cut the haunches. Rough fitted all 4 joints. They go together but not all the way home yet.
May 7,  2022 Adjusted the fit of all 4 mortice and tenons. Sawed the taper on the front upright.
May 8,  2022 Shaped the mouldings at the top of the front leg, added the radius on the left foot and cleaned up the taper on the left front leg.
May 9,  2022 Glued the 2 frames together. Used Spanish windlass to clamp it and they aren't really fast enough (or I'm not fast enough), left with some tiny gaps. I should have taken the time out to build some sash cramps.
May 10, 2022 Cleaned up the 2 frames.
May 12, 2022 Went looking for metal to make the big square nuts to embed in the lathe parts. Ended up at Tuan's shop to see if he knew where to go and came away with some offcuts that will do the job nicely. Also found out he can cast iron which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
May 13, 2022 Made the first nut. Tapping it was difficult, I think the hole was a fraction too small for the tap. Thread came out well though. Cut the recess for the first nut and fitted it.
May 14, 2022 Marked out the remaining 7 square nuts and drilled and tapped them. Used a 1/2inch drill as recommended on the chart. Tapped easier, but the threads are not as deep, there is a visible flat on the top. Will investigate using a 12mm drill and a taper tap when I can get them.
May 15, 2022 Fitted the first of the bedway separator pieces and cut and fit the second.
May 16, 2022 Clamped the 2 side frames together and planed the bottom so the top surfaces are level. Visited Tuan to get the remaining 7 nuts cut out. Staightened the bolts and marked out the other 3 slots in the bedways.
May 17, 2022 Drilled the slots for the remaining 3 nuts and chiseled out the first of them and fitted the nut.
May 18, 2022 Fitted the remaining nuts and assembled the bedways. 
May 19, 2022 Started refining the fit of the Holtzapffel dovetails using carbon paper and a scraper chisel.
May 24, 2022 Did some more work on the Holtzapffel dovetails on the left hand end of the bedways. got them roughly right and started to work on the right hand end ones. Not going to push it too far, don't want to retrigger my bad back. Lifting the 15/16 kg frames on and off the bench is risky.
May 25, 2022 Completed the fitting of the Holtzapffel dovetails.
May 27, 2022 Started to prep the top back horizontal for the lathe. Got the face side and face edge done and started on the thickness. Ordered the flywheel shaft and bearings and the headstock/tailstock shaft.
May 28, 2022 Finished prepping the back piece and marked the tenons.
May 29, 2022 Cut the tenons.
May 30, 2022 Drilled the mortices and cut them.
May 31, 2022 Drilled the nut mortices and cut the first one.
Jun 1,  2022 Cut the second nut mortice. Fitted the nuts and bolted the back piece in. Moved the drill press back outside.
Jun 2,  2022 Cut the groove in the back horizontal piece.
Jun 3,  2022 Cut 2 pieces (and cleaned off the dirt with a hosepipe) for the motor mount bar and the lower back horizontal
Jun 4,  2022 Started prepping the motor mount bar. Put my back out turning while sitting on the saw horse. Was reaching for the try-plane to put the blade back in after sharpening. There was a very slight twinge earlier. Must learn to listen to those.
Jun 13, 2022 Finished squaring off the motor mount piece. Had to fettle the top iron of the try plane. Shavings were going straight under it. Putting a burr on it fixed it. This plane is always difficult to adjust, I don't know why. Maybe I drive the wedge in too hard, it might not be necessary.
Jun 14, 2022 Cut the tenon on the motor mount and fitted it
Jun 15, 2022 Drilled the hole for the rear bolt on the motor mount and drilled and cut the tenon for the nut. Drilled the hole for the front mount and made a spacer. Marked the position of the matching hole in the side frame.
Jun 16, 2022 Drilled the hole in the side frame for the motor mount. Remade the spacer. Fitted the motor mount bar.
Jun 18, 2022 Went to visit Tuan and get some more square nut blanks cut. Met Tu, and got a demo of the new laser cutter machine they had put together.
Jun 19, 2022 Tipped the lathe onto it's back and started to clean up the front surface. Back twinge so I gave up. Might have caught it early enough this time.
Jun 21, 2022 Smoothed out the front face of the front bedway and stood the lathe up again very carefully.
Jun 22, 2022 Prepared face side and face edge on the bottom horizontal piece. Concentrating on controlled movements. This is tricky, momentum can help start a heavy cut and it's not possible to know just how much force a given cut will take until it starts actually cutting. Ordered a flywheel and a temporary pulley, plus some flanges that may do for the headstock pulley boss and faceplates. 
Jun 23, 2022 Reduced bottom horizontal piece to width and thickness, marked out the length.
Jun 24, 2022 Cut the bottom horizontal piece to length and marked out and cut the tenons. Sunk the nut on the front of the motor mount piece.
Jun 25, 2022 Setup camera and photographed the pages of the first of Grandma's photo albums.
Jun 26, 2022 Drilled the mortices for the bottom back bar and chopped the first one.
Jun 27, 2022 Chopped the second mortice for the bottom back bar.
Jun 28, 2022 Drilled the holes in the side frame for the back bar bolts by hand. Marked the position of the longitudinal holes in the back bar. Brought the drill press in and set it up and drilled the holes. Took the drill back outside again.  
Jun 29, 2022 Cut the nut mortices and fitted the bottom back bar.
Jun 30, 2022 Reviewed state of Steve's mobile and started looking for some pieces to make the remaining planets and moons.
Jul 2,  2022 Cut out a new version of Saturn for Steve's mobile. Also Neptune, but that broke when trilling it for the hanging thread. Added threads to the sun, mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Made a new drill to make the holes, from a fine needle (24thou or thereabouts).
Jul 3,  2022 Photographed one of Grandma's photo albums and made a pdf version.
Jul 5,  2022 Made mars, earth and a new Neptune.
Jul 6,  2022 Tried to make some moons from the shell disks from some kind of sea snail. Drilling was not successful and trying to use the grinder to create a disc with a view to turning a groove in the edge to take the thread was also unsuccessfull. Decided to use wood and drew out some patterns for the moons and Pluto. 
Jul 7,  2022 Cut out 8 moons (1 spare) in various sizes from 6mm to 10mm
Jul 8,  2022 Started hanging planets.
Jul 9,  2022 More planet hanging, got as far as Uranus. Cats got at it at while I was sleeping after lunch. Much trouble trying to disentangle it. Galilean moons were worst hit, some will need restringing.
Jul 10, 2022 Got as far as Pluto. Also restrung using little hooks so it's easy to take it apart for packing and gives the option of stopping at mars. Completed, ready for packing. Largest piece is 26inches, too long for hand luggage. Guess that means I will be taking my rucksack after all.
Jul 11, 2022 Packed the outer planets in paper sleeves.
Jul 12, 2022 Replaced the thread on the sun with a wire loop tied in place. Photographed Grandmas other photo album. Made a box to pack the mobile in.
Jul 13, 2022 Remade the packaging for Steve's mobile. First version was too tight, risky trying to get it in and difficult to get it back out. This one has 3 layers of card in between the 2 sides instead of 2.
Aug 20, 2022 Sorted out Les' old drill bits, cleaned up the folding allen key set and restored Mum's propelling pencil.
Aug 21, 2022 Made a backing plate for the imperial drill holder.
Sep 18, 2022 Much thinking, planing, and drawing over the last month. Finally got to cutting a template for the wooden sections of the flywheel rim.
Sep 19, 2022 Cut some stock into manageable pieces for the wheel rim and brought it inside. Did a little more carving on the owl netsuke. Squared up a piece of polycarbonate for a 60-30 square.
Sep 20, 2022 Completed the 60-30 square. Cut out 6 sections of the wheel rim.
Sep 21, 2022 Cut the other 6 and planed face side and edge on all 12. May have to refine the first 2 or 3 some more.
Sep 22, 2022 Planed one end of 7 of the segments of the flywheel rim to the correct angle. Left the block plane and the smoothing plane sharpened for tomorrow.
Sep 23, 2022 Planed the rest of the face-end of the segments of the wheel. Measured the length, adjusted the 2 smallest outliers by taking a little off the inner face, then marked them all to the same length. 
Sep 24, 2022 Planed all 12 segments to length. Just cut to the marked line. Some error may have crept in, it looks like one or two are not perfectly square between the ends and the face side. Adjusting that will be next, hopefully without messing up the length. I think they really need to match in length.
Sep 25, 2022 Adjusted ends so they are all square and marked out the halving joints.
Sep 26, 2022 Cut 6 of the halving joints
Sep 27, 2022 Cut the rest of the halving joints. Cleaned up the first 2.
Sep 28, 2022 Cleaned up the rest of the halving joints.
Sep 29, 2022 Cut the rebate on the first 3 sections and fitted the joints
Sep 30, 2022 Glued the first 3 sections together.
Oct 1,  2022 Prepared the bar for the bar clamp.
Oct 2,  2022 Cut the end block and drilled it. Marked out the joint.
Oct 3,  2022 Cut the joint for the bar clamp. Glued it up. Cut out the sliding piece.
Oct 4,  2022 Made the metal pieces for the bar clamp.
Oct 5,  2022 Cut the notches in the bar clamp. Shaped the sliding piece and drilled it. Rounded the end of the 2 straps. Put the bar clamp together.
Oct 6,  2022 Added the feet to the bar clamp. Needed a 12mm drill for the insert in the rotating foot and the one I bought from the local hardware shop turned out to be bent. I tried to straighten it, probably doomed to failure with an HSS bit. Sure enough it shattered leaving me with just enough to sharpen. Now it is tiny but it cuts perfectly.
Oct 7,  2022 New 6mm tap and die arrived. Cut the threads to finish of the metalwork and oiled the clamp.
Oct 9,  2022 Cleaned up the joints of the 4th 5th and 6th sections of the wheel rim and glued them together. Rough prepped the bar for a second bar clamp.
Oct 10, 2022 Cleaned up the joints of the 7th 8th and 9th sections of the wheel rim and glued them together. Sharpened the medium rip saw.
Oct 11, 2022 Cleaned up the joints of the 10th 11th and 12th sections and glued them.
Oct 12, 2022 Cut the curve on the inside edge of the 1,2,3 piece of the wheel rim. Bendy plane works nicely. Back twinge so I stopped at the first piece.
Oct 13, 2022 Cut the inside curves on the other 3 pieces of the wheel rim and started to fit the joint between the first 2
Oct 14, 2022 Fitted the remaining joints and refined the inside curve a little. 
Oct 15, 2022 Cut the curve in the rebate of 2 sections of the wheel rim. Decided I need a compass shoulder plane to refine the rebates.
Oct 16, 2022 Started making a compass shoulder plane. Trying to glue things without location in tricky. Next time I will use a pin of some sort. Glued on the second side later in the day. Used some blocks clamped (dry) to the body to help align the slippery glued piece, removing them once the main clamps were tight enough to stop the glued piece sliding about.
Oct 17, 2022 Completed the compass shoulder plane and got it tuned to cut nicely. Cleaned up 2 of the wheel rim pieces.
Oct 18, 2022 Drilled and cut the curve in the rebate on the remaining 2 wheel rim pieces. Roughly cleaned them up with the new plane. Need to close up about a 1inch gap. I think about half of this will go when I finish cleaning up the last pieces. Then will need to deepen the curved surface on the widest to completely close the gap.
Oct 19, 2022 Cleaned up the inside curve of piece 3. Gap is down to about 3/4 inch
Oct 20, 2022 Cleaned up inside curve of piece 4. Gap is down to about 3/8 inch
Oct 21, 2022 More cleanup. Gap is now down to 1/8 inch.
Oct 22, 2022 Started cleaning up the side face of the recess, also taking a little off the inner face. Surface is now almost flat and the gap is almost gone. Still need to do a bit of adjusting on some of the joints. Brass wingnuts arrived and I re-did the point and pencil holder with Pony's help.
Oct 23, 2022 More cleanup of the joints between the 3 piece sections. Managed to break on of the glue joints. Looks like it was a bit starved. Reglued it and also glued the first 2 of the 3 piece sections together to make a half circle. Will need to treat it gently until the overlapping pieces of the second layer are added.
Oct 24, 2022 More joint cleanup. Glued the other 2 three piece sections together. Flattened the face of the first 6 part section.
Oct 25, 2022 Started to cut the outside curve of the first 3 piece section of the wheel. Hard going, might just wait till I can turn it. Flattened the face of the 2nd 3 piece section of the flywheel. Added a shim to the joint between section 12 and section 1 where I had cut too much away.
Oct 26, 2022 More fitting. Broke one of the joints again. Not enough clamps to glue that and glue the 2 6 part sections together at the same time. Went out and bought 6 more clamps and an angle grinder to finish off the metalwork. Glued the sections together.
Oct 27, 2022 Removed the flywheel/pulley from the glued up sections and used the wire brush attachment in the angle grinder to clean it up.
Oct 28, 2022 Started grinding off the rough patches on the flywheel/pulley.
Oct 29, 2022 More grinding. Lots of sneezing, I guess I'm reacting to the fine iron particles.
Oct 30, 2022 Made a makeshift stand so I can rotate the wheel without having to lift it out of the metalwork vice and turn it. The front section of the vice had to pass between 2 spokes in order to grip the boss. In theory this is simple, but in practice lifting 23Kg of wheel and manoeuvering it to just the right angle is a pain. The stand is just a beam with a hole near the end and a bolt to hang the wheel on. This should make finishing off the wheel a lot easier. 
Oct 31, 2022 More grinding. Sometimes the dust from grinding cast iron turns my skin orange. I guess it must be rust...
Nov 1,  2022 Went to visit Tuan and asked him what was the best paint for cast iron. Came away with some 2 part black paint to use.
Nov 2,  2022 More work on the flywheel, this time with files. They work quite well where the surface has been removed.
Nov 3,  2022 Back to using the angle grinder, now doing the faces of the arms of the flywheel and the outer rim.
Nov 4,  2022 Just cleaning today. Black dust everywhere. Now have a tin full of iron. Collected using a magnet inside a plastic bag.
Nov 5,  2022 Painted the wheel. Great paint, didn't expect it to be matt. Dries fast but the mixed stuff seems to last.
Nov 6,  2022 Cleaned up the floor scraper the decorators left. Tightened the head and painted it. Planed the face side of the next piece of the beam that will become the other face of the wheel. Painted the toolrest.
Nov 7,  2022 Painted the inside of the slot in the toolrest. Mixed paint is still usable. Cut a kerf for the 7/8inch plank for some of the face sections of the wheel. Started to saw it. Stopped to sharpen the saw. Cuts almost twice as fast now. Got about 2/3 of the way down the plank.
Nov 8,  2022 Completed the saw cut. Made a bracket to hang the coping saw in the front of the chest. Cut a kerf for a 1/4inch plank which will remove the part damaged by nails leaving enough to cut another 7/8 inch plank for the remaining outer sections of the flywheel.
Nov 9,  2022 Cut the 1/4inch plank and the 7/8inch plank. First was easy, second a bit more tricky because the cut came to the surface. This tends to make the cut wander outwards leaving something to plane off. Considering the best way to handle this. No conclusions yet. Tried to put the cast iron wheel back into the wooden rim. It didn't want to fit so I removed it again.
Nov 10, 2022 Cleaned up the inside of the wooden rim and got the cast iron wheel back in again. Manoeuvring it is tricky and painful. Also managed to break one of the joints. Should be easy enough to glue up again once the outer layer piece over that joint goes on.Started to make a plug for the centre of the wheel boss to locate the compass point. This was tricky as it needed to be 40mm and the maximum that the metal turning lathe can take is around 25mm. Ended up using the headstock shaft and a cupchuck from the old lathe with the crosslide and a metal turning tool serving as a back centre. Made a temporary toolrest from a block of wood, a threaded insert and a piece of angle iron. The iron didn't want to be drilled.
Nov 11, 2022 Heated up the iron on the cooker and sharpenned the drill bits I blunted on it yesterday. Made the hole and completed the toolrest. Very carefully turned the plug. Layed out the screw holes on the wooden rim.
Nov 12, 2022 Drilled all 48 holes by hand. Made some pins to mark the holes in the outer pieces from the holes in the existing rim. Cut the first 2 outer pieces and fitted them over the broken joint and the one next to it. Near disaster when I tried to use the brace to drive a screw and it sheared off. Managed to drill most of it out. Thread extractor didn't work as expected but seems to have pushed the remainingbrass outwards enough to allow a new screw to pass and bite in the wood below it. Thankfully the screw broke before it was close to fully home. Not entirely happy with the hole placement. I should have left more room at the end with the upper part of the half lap. Not going to redrill all 48 holes unless I have to. I think there is more than enough glue area for strength.
Nov 13, 2022 Glued up the separated joint and added the corresponding outer piece. Continued adding outer pieces and got half way round the wheel before running out of glue. Put some on to soak ready for tomorrow. Started planing how I might use the electric router to remove some of the waste once the wheel is all glued up. I don't much like the thing, too noisy, but it will probably help if the flywheel is almost round befor I try turning it.
Nov 14, 2022 Made up the new batch of glue and added 4 more pieces. Only 2 to go.
Nov 15, 2022 Glued the last 2 pieces of the flwheel rim. Found a piece to make the router arm guide.
Nov 16, 2022 Made up a guide for the router and rounded off one side of the flywheel. The other is already partially done with the compass plane. Might round it a little more with the saw and compass plane, but it's probably ok to just turn it at this point. 
Nov 17, 2022 Clean up and dismantle the lathe frame to add the bearing support extensions. Start prepping a piece for the extensions.
Nov 18, 2022 resaw the piece for the bearing support extensions. Rough cut both pieces.
Nov 19, 2022 Finish shaping the bearing support extensions and glue and screw them in place.
Nov 20, 2022 Cut the bearing mounting surface to be parallel to the outer surface of the frame, ie coplanar with the extension pieces.
Nov 21, 2022 Put the lathe frame back together and fitted the shaft and flywheel. It turns reasonably freely although there is a slight scraping at one point. Loosening the bearing mount at the right hand side reveals that it is trying to move backwards at one point which implies the shaft is not quite parallel to the axis of the left hand bearings rotation. It's not far off and hopefully will wear in. There is a lot of momentum in the wheel... Considering using the saw horse as a freestanding tool rest support to turn the wheel.
Nov 22, 2022 Mostly planing what to do next. Considering redesigning the headstock so the thread guides are to the right of the pulley so I can have the flywheel as far to the left as possible. Hung the dragon up, and figured out how to dismantle Dad's old parker 51. The breather tube was blocked  so it wouldn't fill. Had to use the hairdryer to heat it up around the metal band area to get the nib cover to unscrew. Also used some strands of wire to poke at the dried ink in the breather tube. Seems to work ok now. Re-alligning the nib was a bit fiddly. Have to unscrew the cover section to move it around so it lines up with the cover section when it is tghtened. Got it on about the 4th go.
Nov 23, 2022 Cleaned up and sharpened my turning tools.
Nov 24, 2022 Trying to find a piece for the headstock. Planed the face of the 5x5 I sit on at the drill press. Might do the job depending on how bad the crack is.
Nov 25, 2022 Drawing possible designs for the headstock. Would like to keep the flywheel as far to the left as possible and the Bergeron style screw cutting headstock would push it a long way to the right.
Nov 26, 2022 More drawing. Also started trying to print out the APL book.
Nov 27, 2022 Sewed and glued APL book
Nov 28, 2022 Trimmed APL book
Nov 29, 2022 Marked out cut line on the headstock piece. Going to cut this without the aid of the kerfing plane, and the cut will be the reference surface. Used a ruler in a shallow cut on one end and sighted along the piece to mark the other end.
Nov 30, 2022 Cut the headstock piece, removing most of the crack. Squared up the face side and face edge and started marking it out.
Dec 1,  2022 Cut the headstock piece to length, width and thickness. Continued marking out and made knife walls for the tenon and screw cutting section crosscuts.
Dec 2,  2022 Cut the tenon and the recess for the screwcutting section. Drilled the bolt hole and fitted the square plate that will be the nut.
Dec 3,  2022 Trimmed the tenon so the headstock piece can sit 1 inch further to the left. Drilled and tapped the square nut. Cleaned and sharpened the tapered reamer, the one made out of jarrah with a square end that fits in a sycamore handle. Shavings were getting between the wood and the blade, andthe blade was quite rusty in places. 2 of the screws were not tightening properly so I mved the larger of them down to the smaller hole and found a new one.
Dec 4,  2022 More marking out on the headstock section. Cut the recess for the wedge. There is some rot around the area of the cup-shake. Used some superglue to help consolidate it. Looks a lot darker but I'm hoping that it will be roughly the same as the wood when it is oiled.
Dec 5,  2022 Adjusted the marking out to take account of the thickness of the brass. I want the top of the curve below the bead to be level with the outer face of the brass above it, which means the bead needs to be 3mm thicker and the curve should end 3mm further out. Deepened the recess for the nut. It is now slightly below the bottom of the recess for the wedge, which will allow for some cleanup. Cut the bearing section and the outer edge of the bead. Cut the first curve.
Dec 6,  2022 Cut the other 2 curved sides of the left hand headstock piece. Cut a wooden plate to bridge the lower surfaces of the bedways for the bolt.
Dec 7,  2022 Resawed some more wood for the right hand part of the headstock. Worked out a way to get the tailstock to fit the metal lathe. Will get some 4mm stuff to shim up the headstock and take about 2mm off the bottom of the tailstock. This will not only give a more solid tailstock than cutting it in 2 horizontaly and bolting the 2 pieces back together, but will also allow for use of 10mm or 12mm tools. These are a lot easier to find and will be more robust.
Dec 8,  2022 Cut the right hand headstock piece to length width and height. Marked it out and made knife walls for the cross-cuts that meet the final surface. Dismantled the metal turning lathe headstock so I can prepare for shimming it up. Marked out the the base of the tailstock ready for filing.
Dec 9,  2022 Marked out the right hand headstock piece and cut the bearing suupprt section.
Dec 10, 2022 Cut the curves on the right hand headstock piece. Cut away some of the cracked section under the screw guide and glued in a filler piece.
Dec 11, 2022 Cleaned up the filler piece and refined the surfaces some more with a scraper. 
Dec 12, 2022 Cut some templates to try different shapes for the bearing covers. Used the router to round of the wheel some more.
Dec 19, 2022 Cut a strip of brass for the bearing covers. Marked out and drilled 2 of them.
Dec 20, 2022 Cut another strip of brass and marked out and drilled the other 2 pieces. Sawed them apart and cut the outline of the first.
Dec 21, 2022 Filed the first 2 pieces to shape.
Dec 22, 2022 Adjusted the countersinking of all holes and refined the shape of the screw tabs on the first 2 bearing covers. Filed the other 2 pieces to shape.
Dec 23, 2022 Removed the headstock pieces and started flattening the bedways using the granite plate. Caught my middle finger between the granite and the spacer block. Will probably lose the nail.
Dec 24, 2022 More flattening. Almost there, probably another day to go. Started trying to remove the worn out abrasive from the other side of the granite plate. Hard going, the glue is strong (contact adhesive). I think I will try aninal glue next time, it doesn't need stick that well given the huge surface area and small sideways force. The fabric based abrasive is even harder to remove. Managed to loosen a few inches either end, which should work well as handles as I complete the sanding of the bedways.
Dec 25, 2022 More flattening, only 5 sets of 50 today. Still got a little way to go.
Dec 26, 2022 More flattening. 10 sets of 50. Low point on the nearside edge of the front bedway is now gone. Still got a low spot on the back edge of the front bedway at the right hand end, and a low spot at each end on the uprights. These are outside the useable area of the bedways but it would be nice to get them flat.
Dec 28, 2022 Printed and started sewing Clojure book for Pen
Dec 29, 2022 Finished sewing Pen's book and glued and trimmed it.
Jan 3,  2023 Cut the slot for the shaft in the inside right bearing cover. Flattened the bottom surface of the right hand headstock piece and marked the recess for the bearing piece.
Jan 4,  2023 Started flattening the bottom of the left hand headstock piece. Another 5 sets of 50 flattening the bedways. Still a little bit more to do although I wouldn't be too unhappy to use it as is. The low spots are negligeable, or outside the useful area.
Jan 5,  2023 Started work on the tailstock for the metal lathe. Cut a piece of 14x14 steel for the guide rail. Drilled lots of holes, including the 60°one for the mounting bolt. Tilted the drill press table and bolted the tailstock down. Set the angle initially to avoid skid, then adjusted it to the correct angle once the bit was in deep enough. Drilled and tapped the guide piece. Managed to break a tap in the 3rd hole, guess I was getting careless by that point. Got it out eventually. Managed to turn it a bit, but then it stuck. Shattered a few pieces off it then drove it back out. Carried on then with the second tap (taper tap was the one that broke) and the resulting thread is fine.
Jan 6,  2023 Drilled and sawed the last 2 holes in the tailstock base. The ones that overlap with the pre-drilled ones. Snapped my only junior hacksaw blade, so I finished off by cleaning up and sharppening the tiny cold chisel and using that. Then filed the rest out. Did some more eork on flattening the base of the left hand headstock piece.
Jan 7,  2023 Finished flattening the base of the left hand headstock piece. Cleaned up the recess for the bearing retainer plate on the right hand headstock piece and screwed the plate on.
Jan 8,  2023 Cut the recess for the inner bearing retainer plate on the left hand headstock piece.
Jan 9,  2023 Finished the recess, trimmed the top edge of the plate to size and screwed it on. Cut the outer bearing retaining plate slot for the right hand headstock piece. Marked and cut the recess and screwed it on. Started restoring the old paint scraper.  Cut and drilled the scales. Screwed them in place and started shaping.
Jan 10, 2023 Completed shaping the paint scraper handle.
Jan 11, 2023 Started work on the metal lathe alterations. Cut the aluminium spacers 
Jan 12, 2023 Finished fitting the spacers and reassembled the headstock.
Jan 13, 2023 Started work on the tailstock. Looks like there will be around 2.5mm to remove, but will re-measure once the base is roughly flat. Started chiseling.
Jan 14, 2023 Tailstock base roughly flattened. Still about 2mm too high. Started trying to do some heavy removal with the cold chisel. Rough estimate of 1 week of solid hammering to remove this 2mm layer.
Jan 15, 2023 Dismantled the flywheel shaft and recut the thread on the flywheel. It was damaged by overtightening the bolt that was holding it, causing the end of the bolt to swell and stick as I removed it. It had come out ok, but the new grubscrew didn't go in easily. Filed up the T nut to fit the gap in the metal lathe bedways, and made an angled spacer washer for the head of the bolt that will hold down the tailstock. As it is, it is causing the tailstock to mover forward slightly rather than pulling it back as it should. A spacer under the front edge fixes that, so I have the rough dimensions now to make another. I will wait until the tailstock lower surface is reduced enough for it to line up with the headstock before making a new spacer waasher. Found some stock to make a copy of the stool in "Beginning Japanology, Sashimono woodwork". Started prepping it.
Jan 16, 2023 Marked up and cut the pieces for the stool. Got the taper the wrong way round, but decided to continue. Goes together nicely and I think I can recover from the mistake. Have still to do the locking bar but it is already fairly sturdy and reasonably comfortable. Do need to round of the corners a bit though. The side plane works quite well but has a tendancy to cut a lateral groove. A fence with a sloping face would fix this nicely. There may be enough left of the 10x50 brass bar to make one once I have made the bearing retainer top pieces for the lathe headstock.
Jan 17, 2023 Added an inlet piece to fix the wrong taper. Cut the recess for the locking bar. Started cutting the slots for the locking bar.
Jan 18, 2023 Finished the slots for the locking bar, and the matching slots in the locking bar. Fitted the dovetail bars on the sides of the legs. Rounded the corners, cleaned it all up and oiled it.
Jan 19, 2023 Started looking at the Hurdy Gurdy again. Will keep the back and just fill the small worm holes. Found a piece for the edge where the soundboard will mount, and a possible piece for the top bars. Cleared out a load of scraps so it is easier to find the good stuff.
Jan 24, 2023 Cut a piece to make the top ribs of the hurdy gurdy. Cut out the paper templates for them.
Jan 25, 2023 Cut the outer curve of the first top rib.
Jan 26, 2023 Marked out the inner curve of the first top rib. Used the adjustable brace bit to mark the tight part of the curve, and a marking gauge to mark the part parallel to the outer surface.
Jan 27, 2023 Cut the inner curve and cleaned it all up. Cut the second piece, but managed to break it cleaning up the inner curve. Will make it again, It needs to be strong.
Jan 28, 2023 Made a replacement top rib.
Jan 29, 2023 Glued in the top binding strips and fitted the ribs. Top ribs are too deeply curved. Not sure if it was deliberate, but the curve of the end pieces is less than on the plans so the top rib ship stands too high. Need to make them again. Started looking for stock.
Jan 30, 2023 Found some likely stock. Used the infinite radius compasses to make a template with a shallower curve to match the end pieces. Roughly marked out the stock for 2 ribs.
Jan 31, 2023 Cut the outer curve, and then separated the 2 pieces. Cut them to length, fitted the first and cut the 3rd top rib.
Feb 1,  2023 Fitted the remaining top ribs and the shaft. Marked out the lower curves.
Feb 2,  2023 Cut the lower curve of the 3rd top rib. Made the soundpost for it and glued it in place.
Feb 3,  2023 Cut the lower curves of the first 2 top ribs, made the soundposts and glued them in. Started looking for soundboard stock. I have some old drawer bottoms that look like top quality spruce. Should be enough there.
Feb 4,  2023 Flattened the upper surface of the hurdy gurdy body. Filled the worm holes with super glue and sawdust. Marked out the crank shape on the brass blank.
Feb 5,  2023 Cut out the crank with the jewelers saw. Broke a few blades but they cut fairly well. Filed it up, looks pretty good.
Feb 6,  2023 More flattening of the lathe bedways (500 reps). Still very small marks from the toothing plane on the bedways, a scratch at the headstock end and a small low patch at the tailstock end. It's flat enough. Finished removing the old abrasive cloth from the granite plate. That was hard work, but got a bit faster with the right technique.
Feb 7,  2023 Made a template for the lower frame members of the lathe.
Feb 8,  2023 Cut the lower frame members. Didn't dismantle the lathe, just tipped it onto it's back. It has enough mass that a bench and vice were just not needed. Good job, I'm reluctant to take it appart. Not sure if it will go back together again in exactly the same position and I don't want to have to resurface the bedways.
Feb 9,  2023 Marked out the brass bearing caps and drilled the holes for the hinges. Drilled a 9.8mm hole to provide the curved surface to fit with the other hinge pieces. Sawed the pieces to length and cut the waste away from the top surface with the hacksaw.
Feb 10, 2023 Started filing the curve into one of the top surfaces. Gave up and went to buy some new files (also a 1kg hammer and a blowtorch)
Feb 12, 2023 Finished the roughing out of the front and back curves on one bearing cover piece and started on the second one.
Feb 13, 2023 Finished roughing out the front and back curves on the second bearing cover piece.
Feb 14, 2023 Refined the front and back curves on the bearing cover pieces and started work on the hinge inner curve. Found a piece to make the nut slot cover. Attempted some engraving. Freehand is no good, need a stop or the chances of over-running the cut are too high.
Feb 15, 2023 Made the cover plate for the nut slot in the front headstock piece. Engraved the year in roman numerals MMXXIII. Screwed the blank to a piece of wood and used the machinists clamp to hold a piece of wood against the horizontal line as a stop. Recessed the headstock for it and screwed it in place. Used the granite sanding plate to flatten the surface. Had to redo the engraving as this took most of it away.
Feb 16, 2023 First attempt at a hinge piece. Works well, new blowtorch anneals the brass easily and hammering the brass around the 3mm pin is not too hard. I misscalculated the expected OD. I thought I had bought 3mm brass, but it is 2mm. The 9.8mm holes I drilled in the top piece are too large. Not a big deal, but it would be nice to have a fairly close fit. Will redo the hinge piece with 5mm rod instead. It will bring the OD back to the expected size. Looking at the length required for the hinge roll, it seems to have stretched by about 6mm. OD is 7mm, expected length with no stretching of the outer surface would be about 22mm. Actual length seems to be about 16mm. I marked a series of lines at 5mm intervals before starting to roll the hinge. The back fold at the end of the roll is somewhere between the 25mm and 20mm lines
Feb 17, 2023 Made a new hinge piece. Well acually it's the other end of the same one. Has a 5mm pin and the hinge fold ended up at around the 25mm line on the blank, so it looks like it only stretched by about 3mm I think.
Feb 18, 2023 Made 3 more hinge pieces.
Feb 19, 2023 Planed beam for the second sash cramp to size. Needed multiple sharpennings. Whatever it is, it is hard and has white streaks init which I guess could be silica.
Feb 20, 2023 Squared up and sawed a 2in by 3in piece out of a length of 4in by 2-1/2in beam for the end block of the 2nd sash cramp. Drilled the hole for the screw. Lots of gouge work, the only bit large enough to do the job is the adjustable one, which wont go in very far before the cross piece hits the surface.
Feb 21, 2023 Cut the joint for the sash cramp.
Feb 22, 2023 Cut the notches in the sash cramp bar and glued up the two pieces. Also glued the nuts in on both sash cramps.
Feb 23, 2023 Got the metal lathe working again with the raised headstock. Cleaned up the external clutch mechanism. Started turning the pin for the 2nd sash cramp.
Feb 24, 2023 Completed the pin for the 2nd sash cramp, made the base plate and twisting footrest. Assembled it all.
Feb 25, 2023 Cut some more of the grooves in the tailstock base plate using the new cold chisel.
Feb 26, 2023 Not much today. Tried to figure out if the piece of metal for the circular cold chisel is hardened or not. Seems not, but I will grind it rather than file it I think.
Feb 27, 2023 Started work on cleaning out the corners of the hinge joints on the bearing covers. Recorded it.
Feb 28, 2023 More work on cleaning the hinge corners, and another recording done closer using the mic stand as a tripod. One bearing cap is now ready for fitting to the hinge pieces.
Mar 1,  2023 Fitted the pins for one of the bearing caps.
Mar 6,  2023 Did a little more work on the tailstock base. The grooves on one half are down to the right level now.
Mar 7,  2023 Fitted the first headstock cap hinge pieces together and rounded the cap piece to match the side piece.
Mar 8,  2023 Cut another groove (the 4th) in the tailstock base. It will need a little more work to get to full depth.
Mar 9,  2023 Cut 2 more grooves. Starting to get larger and more even chips. 
Mar 10, 2023 Decided to cut another groove in between the existing ones. Gut the first of these (the 7th) and cut the first of the separating walls away.
Mar 11, 2023 Removed the second separating wall. Cut the next groove and removed 2 more separating walls. One side is now roughed out.
Mar 12, 2023 Fitted the second hige on the first bearing cover for the lathe headstock,
Mar 13, 2023 Prepared a strip of 1/4 by 3/4 to try out a possible solution to the puzzle joint.
Mar 14, 2023 Cut the pieces and assembled a trial version of the puzzle joint.
Mar 15, 2023 A little more cold chisel work on the metal turning lathe tailstock base.
Mar 16, 2023 Filming how to use a cold chisel
Mar 17, 2023 Completed the roughing out of the tailstock base and started refining it. It sits a bit high, maybe 1mm
Mar 18, 2023 Continued refining the underside of the metal lathe tailstock.
Mar 19, 2023 A little more refining. Set up the tailstock again to check for amount of vertical offset. Looks like about .84mm
Mar 20, 2023 And a little more refining.
Mar 21, 2023 More refining.
Mar 22, 2023 More refining.
Mar 23, 2023 More refining.
Mar 24, 2023 Reassembled the tailstock and removed the abrassive paper from the bedways. Marked out a new piece of steel for the sloping washer.
Mar 25, 2023 Cut the sloping washer and tested out the tailstock. Managed to break a centre drill but successfully turned an old bolt into a handle for the second sash cramp. The tailstock needs some more refining, it is pretty accurate with the rotating centre in and minimal extension, but the drill chuck is longer and needs the tailstock to be srewed out further and the point of the drill ends up about 1mm low. Oiled the second sash cramp.
Mar 27, 2023 Put the lathe parts back together and changed speed to the fastest. Turned up a point to use to check alignment. The faster speed makes quite a difference to the finish. For such small pieces (I used a piece of an old 14mm bolt) the faster speed makes sense and it isn't at all scary, not with the clutch.
Mar 28, 2023 More refining work on the base of the tailstock. There was a high point about 2/3 of the way back. The front half made good contact, but it was causing a slant that meant the alignment got worse the further the tailstock was extended. removed that and the tailstock point is now a little high (as expected). Did some more refining work using the chisel, scraper and file. Covered the surface in marker pen and slid it back and forth on the bedways to monitor progress. 
Mar 29, 2023 Finished off the base of the tailstock. Used the scraper quite a bit. It can give quite a good surface, especially with a nicely sharpened edge. It works ok straight from the grinder, but leaves a better surface if it is honed too.  The centres now align nicely, tested by trapping a ruler between them. It stands perpendicular on both axes. Cut a slice off the bottom of one of the 14mm parting tools so that now fits in the tool holder. Found a tin for the bits and spacers I can use, including a newly cut 4mm full length spacer. Drilled a hole in the vice base to fix it to the wooden base so I can use the mounting hole to bolt it to the bench. Broke a screw, I had forgotten just how hard that base piece is. Got it out using the small metalwork vice to grip the protruding part. Used a bolt and a threaded insert instead.
Mar 30, 2023 More work on the second bearing cap cover. Bought some bolts so I can hold the metalwork vice down at 2 points instead of relying on just one and the weight. Now it should stay put under heavy hammering and will look better on video.
Mar 31, 2023 Recorded video of the process clearing the corners if the hinge joints on the bearing cover caps.
Apr 1,  2023 Fitted one of the strap parts for the second bearing cap and roughly shaped the cylindrical part of the cap to match the strap.
Apr 2,  2023 Fitted the second strap part to the second bearing cap.
Apr 3,  2023 Cut the strap parts to length and cleaned up both headstock pieces ready for fitting the caps.
Apr 4,  2023 Drilled the strap piece attatchment holes and fitted the first one.
Apr 5,  2023 Fitted the other 3 strap pieces. Had to remove some of the carefully made hinge parts where the strap fits to the cap so that it can be opened by pulling out one of the hinge pins. Cleaned up the faces of the front and back of the left hand headstock piece.
Apr 6,  2023 Finished cleaning up the left hand headstock piece with file and 240 grit paper. Oiled it.
Apr 7,  2023 Cleaned up the right hand hesdstock piece and oiled it. Also oiled the left hand piece and the bedways.
Apr 8,  2023 Rough cut the sides of the left hand headstock piece bearing cap. Cut clearance on the right hand headstock piece bearing cap so I can open it by removing the pin. Oiled both pieces again.
Apr 9,  2023 Cut the sides of the other bearing cap and refined both.
Apr 10, 2023 Oiled both parts and glued a locating piece to the piece that goes on the bottom end of the bolt securing the right hand headstock piece. Cleaned out the glue pot.
Apr 11, 2023 Polished the headstock pieces and tried out the dial gauge on the lathe. Not sure whether to use the metal lathe or the new lathe to turn the headstock shaft. It will need to be set up very precisely on the metal lathe.
Apr 12, 2023 Played with setting up the shaft on the metal lathe. Set up a carrier as it is too long for the tailstock. Accuracy is not good enough.
Apr 13, 2023 New chuck arrived so I fitted that. Decided to turn down the boss on the backplate rather than use a spacer plate, which means the old chuck will not locate positively if I put it back. Accuracy is much improved, but I will probably still use the new lathe to turn it's own headstock shaft.
Apr 14, 2023 Started making a converter so I can attatch the cross slide to the new lathe. Will be 2 pieces, one bolted to the cross slide and the other locating in the bedways. The bolt that holds them to the bedways will pass through both. Once it is all adjusted correctly I will glue them together, but that can wait until the headstock shaft and bearings are complete.
Apr 15, 2023 Made the bottom part of the cross slide converter.
Apr 16, 2023 Fitted the 2 pieces, made a bottom plate and cut the bolt to length. It's not complete, but is now useable.
Apr 17, 2023 Cleaned up the bearing cavities. There were 2 screws that were a bit longer than the others that needed to be filed to length, and a hole to be plugged. Also marked the level of the centre line of the shaft so I know when to stop pouring the lead.
Apr 18, 2023 Fixed the broken marking gauge, turned it into a pencil gauge. Marked out and started cutting the bottom plate for attaching the cross slide. Adjusted the top slide shims, then put the cross slide back on the metal lathe.
Apr 19, 2023 Moved the lathe outside ready for pouring the bearings. Cut a 1.5kg diving weight up ready for melting.
Apr 20, 2023 Poured the lower bearings. Used the pottery bbq to help heat the laddle holding the lead. Probably not necessary, it melts quickly and easily with the blowtorch. Completed the bottom plate for attaching the cross slide.
Apr 21, 2023 Poured the first top bearing half. Started rearranging the workshop, put the bench against the wall to the left of the door (going in)
Apr 22, 2023 Poured the second top bearing half. Brought the lathe back in.
Apr 23, 2023 Painted the crankshaft bearing housings, the metal lathe tailstock and the bushes for the eccentric drive. Did some finishing on the frame, and sraped the bedways to remove the graphite that got spilt and was darkening it. At some point I may use graphite on the bedways, but for now I like the look of the wood grain. Cut a curve in the cabinet scraper holder so I don't have to mess about with shims to put a curve into the blade.
Apr 24, 2023 More frame finishing and oiling
Apr 25, 2023 More frame finishing and oiling
Apr 26, 2023 Replaced the flywheel and shaft.
Apr 27, 2023 Cut a piece for the back part of the treadle. Washed it to limit the blunting effect and the mess.
Apr 28, 2023 Prepared the back piece of the treadle, face side, face edge and width. Thickness was already correct.
Apr 29, 2023 Cut a piece for the remaining parts of the treadle and washed it.
Apr 30, 2023 Cut the new piece in half and trued it up. Sawed the lengthwise taper to make 2 of the bars.
May 1,  2023 Cut the second bar to the correct width and cut the third bar.
May 2,  2023 Cut the front piece to width. Cleaned up all the face sides and edges of the treadle pieces. Cleaned up the opposite sides of the 3 bars and the front piece
May 3,  2023 Finished off preparing the back and bottom of the back piece of the treadle. Marked out all the mortice and tenon joints.
May 4,  2023 Cut the outlines of the 6 mortices. Drilled and chopped the 3 in the front bar of the treadle.
May 5,  2023 Drilled and rough cut the 3 mortices in the back bar of the treadle.
May 6,  2023 Crosscut the tenons on all 3 bars of the treadle. Sharpened the 2 back saws.
May 7,  2023 Rip sawed all 6 tenons. Cleaned up and fitted the 1st mortice and tenon joint.
May 8,  2023 Cleaned up and fitted 4 more mortice and tenon joints.
May 9,  2023 Fitted the last mortice and tenon joint and eased all 6 so the treadle will go together.
May 10, 2023 Glued up the treadle.
May 11, 2023 Cleaned up the ends of the tenons and marked out the chamfer on the treadle. Started turning the flywheel.
May 12, 2023 More turning. Using a bungee and a piece of string didn't really work. Kicking the spokes of the flywheel does, and with a bit of practice can be reasonably efficient. Picking a spoke to kick 180 degrees early helps to enable kicking when the wheel is already turning at a moderate speed. Dismantled the lathe and made 2 more protectors for the ends of the bedways.
May 13, 2023 Drilled the holes for the top crosspiece and the treadle pivots. Made the front support for the top crosspiece and screwed it to the back of the bedway. Reasembled the lathe. getting faster at doing this.
May 14, 2023 Made the motor controller mount tray and fitted it.
May 15, 2023 Converted one of the cheap planes to a bullnose plane. The blade is a bit steeper than I would like. I opted to go bevel up as the bed is at 45 degrees which is a bit shallow for a single iron on curly grain. Doesn't feel great to use, but it does leave a nice finish. Angle is about 75°-80°. Bevel up also means there is less of the thin sides for the screws to go through so it is a little bit more robust.
May 16, 2023 Cut a 7in disc for the eccentric drive. Sharpened the bow saw crosscut blade and replaced the string which was starting to fray.
May 17, 2023 Drilled bolt holes to secure the bosses to the eccentric (only in the central position, the eccentric holes still need to be cut and drilled)
May 18, 2023 Drilled and tapped the holes in the bearing covers. Refined the curves a bit more.
May 19, 2023 More shaping of the bearing caps. Started cutting the first piece for the top surface from the old kitchen drawer bottom.
May 20, 2023 Cut some more pieces for the top surface. Not going to use the first ones cut though. There should be enough of the old kitchen table top to make it all of the same wood. Marked where the motor mount holes should go.
May 21, 2023 Dismantled the lathe and drilled the holes for the motor mount. Sunk 2 nuts in the crosspiece and adjusted it so it will sit horizontaly. Re-assembled the lathe.
May 22, 2023 Made some long 14mm bolts and mounted the motor.
May 23, 2023 Made the pivots for the treadle. Modified the lathe top-slide so it can swing further round to cut the points. Turned out it wasn't necessary, the angle of the countersink cut by the centre drill is just within the original range of the topslide. Needed doing anyway, 40° was not enough for some things.
May 24, 2023 Tapered the inside of the ferules. Fitted the first of the ferules for the treadle and chamfered one edge.
May 25, 2023 Fitted the second ferrule and completed all the chamfers. Fitted the treadle and cut one of the pivot bolts to the correct length.
May 26, 2023 Dismantled the lathe and deepened the nut recesses in the top centre piece so the new bolts for the motor mount will reach the embeded nuts.
May 27, 2023 Extended the motor cable.
May 28, 2023 Added a socket to the motor switch box so I can unplug the mains cable.
May 29, 2023 Preped the pieces of the top for gluing up.
May 30, 2023 Glued up the 2 main sections of the top.
May 31, 2023 Cleaned up the 2 main sections and added the supports for the centre section. Fitted the centre section and the front beading.
Jun 1,  2023 Cut a piece of heavy brass tube to mount the eccentric wheel on the headstock shaft. Put it all together ready to turn the chain groove in the eccentric wheel.
Jun 2,  2023 Made the cuptured nut crosspiece to secure the toolrest.
Jun 3,  2023 Drilled the treadle for the motor auctuator. Cut and tapped the pieces of the connecting rods and fixed up a temporary treadle lift using a piece of old inner tube. Initial experiments with the headstock shaft pulley I bought (to modify) didn't work well. The groove is far too wide.
Jun 4,  2023 Made 2 pieces to form a single pulley with adjustable groove width. Made a drive belt from tripled string. At first it didn't work so I cut the motor pulley groove a bit deeper and moved the headstock shaft pulley pieces closer together.
Jun 5,  2023 Tried turning the eccentric pulley. Worked for a bit, but then the belt compacted to a size that is a bit too small and it was slipping again. Made a new belt that can be opened and has 4 rather than 3 bights. First version was too uneven, it was made by twisting 2 pieces together then twisting that. Wrapped the second version by hand and it seems ok. Completed the groove and removed the eccentric.
Jun 6,  2023 Made a small collar to replace the carrier that I used for the eccentric. Set the cross slide up ready to turn the shaft.
Jun 7,  2023 Started making the spring return for the treadle. Cut the pieces and clamped them in position to get the range right.
Jun 8,  2023 Dismantled the lathe and drilled holes in the lower back bar and the treadle for the spring return.
Jun 9,  2023 Fitted the eccentric.
Jun 10, 2023 Cut the shapes of the treadle spring return. Turned a length of threaded rod for the top attachment.
Jun 11, 2023 Turned the flwheel some more. It's easier with the eccentric to push, but I may have bruised my hand doing it. Will be easier when the treadle is connected.
Jun 12, 2023 Made a wire wrap tool.
Jun 13, 2023 Welded the short drive belt and turned the back end of the headstock shaft. Cut the flats to locate external screw cutting attachments (and help hold the shaft to cut the threads on either end)
Jun 14, 2023 Faced of the working end of the headstock shaft. Screwed the 2 parts of the cross-slide base together and glued a locating bar on the lower cross-slide mounting plate.
Jun 15, 2023 Drew some guides for hand cutting the headstock shaft main thread as per Plumier. Cut a piece for the screw cutting guide block.
Jun 16, 2023 Sharpened the carbide tools with the newly arrived diamond stone. Started modifying the cast iron pulley that will be the boss for the headstock shaft pulley. Still having trouble with the parting tool, even freshly sharpened. I think it is only ok for brass, it has no rake. Ordered another with inserts that have some rake.
Jun 17, 2023 Attempted to precut the thread on the headstock shaft. Not successful, turned it off again and tried using the die. Ended up with a badly eccentric thread. I think there is enough length left to cut it off and try again. The pulley could perhaps be used as an extension of the die holder to keep it on track.
Jun 18, 2023 Started making a makeshift die guide. Opted to use wood blocks and M12 bolts rather than drill and tap the pulley.
Jun 19, 2023 Completed the die guide, cut off the bad thread, turned the last 1inch to 19mm, cut a 30° taper and recut the thread. Went straight and the chuck centres quite nicely even though it doesn't have a central boss yet, and doesn't quite reach the shoulder.
Jun 20, 2023 Completed modifying the cast iron pulley. Took a lot of thinking about cutting angles and trying different tools to separate the un-needed flange from the rest.
Jun 21, 2023 Marked out the layers of the headstock pulley. Cut most of them.
Jun 22, 2023 Finished cutting the pulley layers.
Jun 23, 2023 Glued up the 2 parts of the largest pulley layer, and drilled and glued the 2 smaller layers.
Jun 24, 2023 Drilled the larger layer, 5/8 diameter from one side, and around 2 inches diameter from the other. Turned up a locating peg from the bad thread offcut and used it to locate the largest layer in the 4 jaw chuck. Screwed the layer to the chuck plates and turned the hole to fit the boss made from an old pulley.
Jun 25, 2023 Glued the last parts of the pulley together. Marked and drilled the boss.
Jun 26, 2023 Mounted the boss. Managed to break a screw but got lucky drilling it out and used a piece of bamboo chopstick to plug it (its the one nearest the keyway). Mounted the pulley on a length of 20mm shaft in place of the headstock sheft. Turned out the centre hole. It was already at 5/8in so it didn't take long to make it 20mm. Had to clean out a little bit with the gouge so the pulley would slide all the way on the shaft. Turned the outside. Bit messy. Pulley is good but there is lots of dust and it is a bit irritating to my sinuses. Pulley is now 3½ inches wide, tapering from 2 inches to 8½ inches. This should be good for 2, 3½, 5, 6½, and 8 inch steps.
Jun 27, 2023 Completed turning the pulley.
Jun 28, 2023 Drew designs for the treadle pulley mount. Parted off the end of the headstock shaft. Not good to have the parting tool low. The workpiece climbed over the tool and jammed. Actually saw the headstock move forward a little. Nothing was loose, it must have been just the wood flexing. Raised the tool a little and completed the cut, no damage done as far as I can tell.
Jun 29, 2023 Started making a handle for 6mm square hss. Drilled a hole in a piece of 20mm diameter steel and turned it to fit some ¾inch brass tube. Squared up the hole with a file.
Jun 30, 2023 Drilled a side hole for a grub screw. Silver soldered the brass tube and the steel plug. Tried to fit one of my old cup chucks to the new spindle. The wood won't take such a fine thread. Used the cup chuck held in the 4 jaw chuck to start turning a piece of lilac for the handle.
Jul 1,  2023 Completed the handle and ground the graver end so now it has a reversible blade, graver one end, pulley groove form tool on the other.
Jul 2,  2023 Cut a piece for the tailstock and rough shaped it.
Jul 3,  2023 Cleaned up the curved surfaces on the tailstock. Drilled the bolt hole.
Jul 4,  2023 Flattened the lower surface of the tailstock so it sits correctly. Prepared drawing of the treadle pulley side plates for Tuan to make them for me.
Jul 7,  2023 Turned a pulley for the treadle. Faced off the 40mm bar offcut ready for trying to make a ¾ 16tpi internal thread.
Jul 8,  2023 Started drilling the 40mm offcut. Worked fine up to the MT2 14.5mm bit, but the 17.5mm one only got so far before the taper started to slip. There is no room in the tailstock sleeve for a plug piece with internal flats. The screw thread is pretty much the same size as the back end of the taper. A grub screw from the side might do the trick, but it will mean taking the sleeve out every time I change bits. Measured the place to put the grub screw and drilled a hole ready for tapping.
Jul 9,  2023 Tapped the hole and drilled right through so there will be 2 grub screwes. Unfortunately that removed too much metal from the original thread and I had to drill it out for an 8mm grub screw. Seems to work fine. Drilled a bit more with the 17.5, but then it stopped working. I think I reduced the clearance angle a bit too much on the last grinding. Didn't realise that was the problem at first. The outer corners are getting rounded and I reground a few times before comparing it with the 14.5 and seeing the angle was too shallow. Try again tomorrow.
Jul 10, 2023 Gave up trying to use the drill and experimented with the boring tools. Small red one worked reasonably well but I ended up wearing away quite a bit of the underside. Must watch that more closely in future. Tried the yellow one that might actually be an internal thread tool. That worked reasonably well. Cut the thread with a great deal of difficulty. Running the bottoming tap in to help relieve the taper tap seemed to help, but was alternating between the 2 roughly every half rotation.
Jul 11, 2023 Parted off a piece of the 40mm steel bar and mounted it on the new lathe. Cut the recess to allow it to locate on the 20mm part of the shaft. Fitted it and cleaned it up and cut the centre boss to help locate chucks. Seems to have worked. Not going to attempt to thread the other half. Don't like working steel much, at least not this way. Too much brute force needed. Ugly.
Jul 12, 2023 Cut a 2½inch piece of 50mm brass bar for a cup chuck mount using the hacksaw. Got the cut face pretty accurate, estimate ±0.1mm. Faced it and drilled and tapped the hole. Much easier in brass than in steel. Had to regrind the 17.5 drill, but it cut ok. Parted off a piece of it ready for turning the outside. Will do that on the new lathe as it can mount directly on the screw thread so it will be concentric.
Jul 13, 2023 Completed turning the first cup chuck mount and turned the old cup chuck to fit. Made an aluminium spacer to lift the tool post to help make height adjustments.
Jul 14, 2023 Turned up the second cup chuck mount and 2 brass washers for the headstock shaft. Drilled the flange of the first cup chuck mount and fitted the wooden body. Trued it up and re-cut and burned the lines. Waxed the outside.
Jul 15, 2023 Cleaned up the parted off faces of the 2 large brass washers and opened up the holes slightly. Replaced the steel washers on the headstock shaft with them. Turned the recesses for the bearings in the treadle pulley wheel. Prepared 2 old cup-chucks for lead inserts.
Jul 16, 2023 Tried removing the toolpost mounting bolt to check it is just an m10. It is so the quick change toolpost I plan to buy will fit. Cast a thread insert in the smallest cup-chuck.
Jul 17, 2023 Cast another lead thread insert in one of the larger cup chucks. Drilled and tapped it.
Jul 18, 2023 Got the top plates for the tailstock and the thread cutting part of the headstock. Marked out the hole centres for the tailstock piece.
Jul 19, 2023 Drilled and tapped the square nut for the tailstock. Cut the recess for it. Drilled the top plate and filed up the edges. Drilled the tailstock for the top plate mounting bolts. I should have started doing the counterbores for the screw inserts with the piece bolted down. Drill (½inch) grabbed it and ripped it out of my hand and smacked it hard into the front door. No damage to the door or me and only a minor bash on the end of one of the beads, and a small chip that was caused by planing the surface that sits on the bedways and had been reglued is now missing.
Jul 20, 2023 Made the spacer blocks for the tailstock, drilled the hole for the dead centre, tapped the central hole and made a 12mm brass plug to avoid wear on the dead centre. Managed to line up the centres reasonably well.
Jul 21, 2023 Cleaned up the tailstock and oiled it.
Jul 22, 2023 Drawing designs for the oiler/bearing adjusters.
Jul 23, 2023 Cut a piece of 50mm brass and faced it ready for 2 more cup chuck bosses. Turned the 2 old cup chucks ready for the bosses.
Jul 24, 2023 Drilled and tapped the block. Parted it in 2 on the metal lathe, but had to finish off with a hacksaw, the parting tool isn't quite long enough. Turned the first boss by hand using the new lathe and the 6mm graver I made. Fitted it to the large circular cup chuck.
Jul 25, 2023 Tried to set up to film hand turning. I think I got mostly shots of the back of my shoulder. Will have to rethink it. Finished turning the boss for the square cup chuck.
Jul 26, 2023 Got the side plates of the treadle pulley wheel support made by Tuan. Bolted them together and started to file them up. Drilled the boss for the square cup chuck and mounted it.
Jul 27, 2023 Finished shaping the side plates. Some parts seem really hard so I used the grinder. Drilled out and tapped the top hole to take an M12 bolt.
Jul 28, 2023 Drilled out and tapped the bottom holes to take M8 bolts. Cut the wooden part to size.
Jul 29, 2023 Shaped the wooden part and drilled it. Fitted the metal sides. Removed the treadle and drilled that to match.
Jul 30, 2023 Fitted the treadle pulley support and connected the chain. Can't find my chain breaker but managed it with a pin punch. Treadle now working.
Aug 1,  2023 Started turning the grooves in the flywheel. Got some help from Pen and we managed to get the first groove cut. Welded the drive band (a bit too loose, but that's ok for now). Motor can now drive the flywheel, although I don't know how much power it can transmit.
Aug 2,  2023 Turned the inner edges and the sides if the wheel using the motor driving the headstock shaft, and the headstock shaft driving the flywheel. 
Aug 3,  2023 Removed the screws from the flywheel and completed turning the side of the wheel.
Aug 4,  2023 Replaced all the screws, got a couple of blisters doing it.
Aug 5,  2023 More turning of the left face of the flywheel, trying to get the screw heads flush.
Aug 6,  2023 Bought some 40 grit cloth backed abrasive paper and made a larger sanding block. More work on the left face of the flywheel. More to go though, will keep going until either the first screw heads start to appear smaller or all are flush.
Aug 7,  2023 Finished the left face of the flywheel. Sanded a few screw heads by hand, but most by using the 40grit block against the rotating wheel. Made a template to help turning the different steps and started turning them.
Aug 8,  2023 Completed turning the steps, and then the grooves in the flywheel.
Aug 9,  2023 Made the main part of thelocking bolt for the tailstock. Roughed out on the small lathe, but turned the dome on the new lathe using treadle drive. Started roughing out a piece of wood for the handles.
Aug 10, 2023 Started making a small brass cup chuck. Drilled the blank on the metal lathe and rough turned the outside and inside taper on the new lathe. I should probably have turned the recess at the same time as drilling it, turning it accurately proved too difficult.
Aug 11, 2023 Completed the brass cup shuck. All turned by leg power except for the initial hole for the thread. Used the cross slide to get the inside looking reasonably straight and true. Also cleaned up the outside with it. The hand turned suface was mostly better, apart from some small chatter marks, but the slide rest turned finish cleaned up well enough and looks straight. It has a parallel  section and a gentle taper in at the mouth end. Used the cup chuck to turn the first of the tailstock locking bolt handles. Not sure I like the shape, but it will do for now.
Aug 12, 2023 Completed the tailstock locking bolt. I still don't like it but not sure how I can change it... Fitted a bracket to hold the vernier calipers in the toolchest.
Aug 13, 2023 Altered the ends of the old mandrels so they can be carried in the brass cup chuck. Cut a piece of stone rosewood and started to turn it, hopefully an egg and a tool handle.
Aug 14, 2023 Turned an egg for mum. Roughed out the rest of the piece of stone rosewood ready for making a handle.
Aug 15, 2023 Started turning a small box for Nhâm. Mostly completed the wooden part.
Aug 16, 2023 Turned the brass lid for the box and completed the wooden part.
Aug 17, 2023 Modified a bolt for the toolrest. Turned off the head and reduced it to 10mm and cut a thread to attach the brass head. Visited Tuan and asked him to make me a cast iron stool.
Aug 18, 2023 Turned the brass bolt end and cut away the sides to locate in the tool rest banjo.
Aug 19, 2023 Turned a piece of brass for a nut to secure the toolrest. Driled and tapped it and cut the taper using a piece of bolt as a mandrel.
Aug 20, 2023 Started turning the handle pieces. Completed the first washer and ferule. This time the washer has a slight rebate so it locates properly in the end of the ferule. Rough turned the first handle including the steel threaded piece glued in.
Aug 21, 2023 Completed the first handle and turned the second. Fitted them to the tailstock locking bolt and put the ones from the there onto the toolrest securing nut as they are not quite so visible there.
Aug 22, 2023 Made a handle with the remaining piece of 1inch square stock. Cut some more ferules for more small handles and put some bolts and washers in vinegar to remove the zinc.
Aug 23, 2023 Blackened the bolts and one washer by heating to dull red using the gas cooker and quenching in oil. I think it is soya oil from earlier experiments to find a linseed substitute. Worked well. Left the rest of the washers in for a bit longer and put some wire in there too in preparation for silver soldering. Cut a piece of wood for the carrier poppet, squared it up and roughly marked it out.
Aug 24, 2023 Marked out the poppet accurately and sawed it out.
Aug 25, 2023 Shaped the poppet and cut out the recess for the bearing mount piece.
Aug 26, 2023 Turned the recess for the bearing shell in the offcut of the carrier poppet. Trued up the bottom of the poppet and drilled the second piece for 4 screws. Added the countersink inserts. Lined it up using the tailstock and a piece of stone rosewood destined for the turning gouge handle. Clamped the 2 pieces together ready for drilling.
Aug 27, 2023 Finished shaping the carrier poppet and oiled it.
Aug 28, 2023 Did some more drawings for the oiler/bearing-adjuster design. Ready to start making them at last. Drilled a pilot hole and fitted a ferrule on the piece of stone rosewood for the new turning gouge handle.
Aug 29, 2023 Completed and fitted the gouge handle. This stone rosewood is not so easy to turn. Came out ok in the end but it may not be a great choice for flutes.
Aug 30, 2023 Started planning the toolbox. Brought in some planks.
Aug 31, 2023 Cut 2 long pieces for the toolbox. Planed up a 3rd piece for the ends and started cleaning up one of the long pieces. Cut and sharpened a piece of HSS for a double sided marking knife to help in marking out the dovetails. No handle yet, I will try it without before trying to make a tang on HSS.
Sep 1,  2023 Planed face side and face edge of the long pieces of the lathe toolbox.
Sep 2,  2023 Cleaned up the ends of the long pieces and cut the 2 end pieces. Flattened the end pieces, there was still some cupping. Numbered all the joints and marked out the width of the matching piece and the dovetail tails.
Sep 3,  2023 Cut the tails.
Sep 4,  2023 Marked out and cut the pins. Fitted the first joint.
Sep 5,  2023 Fitted the remaining 3 joints and started looking for pieces to make the bottom. There should be just enough of Pen's old bookshelf left to do it.
Sep 7,  2023 Prepared pieces for the bottom of the lathe toolbox. 
Sep 8,  2023 Glued some of the pieces together. Started work on the oiler/adjusters. Drilled out some threaded rod and reduced one end of the first piece and cut a 10mm thread on it for the brass piece. Drilling on the metal lathe works best with an accurate centre. It's easy to break a carbide insert trying to turn this. Badly centred holes will cause problems when drilling from both ends. I managed to break a 3.2mm drill twice. First time it sheared off in the drill chuck so it was easy enough to remove. Second time it broke inside the piece. Not worth trying to dig it out, so I started again.
Sep 9,  2023 Glued another set of pieces together. Cut the 10mm thread on the end of the other oiler shank.
Sep 10, 2023 Glued the last set of pieces together. Cut the brass pieces for the oilers and drilled and tapped them to fit the shanks. Screwed the brass and steel pieces together and trued up the brass relative to the steel shanks. Bored out the top holes ready for the 14mm thread for the caps.
Sep 11, 2023 Cut most of the bottom pieces to the correct length. Cut the rebate for them in the box sides.
Sep 12, 2023 Tapered the thickness of the bottom pieces so they fit the slots. Put the box together without glue.
Sep 13, 2023 Glued up the lathe toolbox. Tapped the cups of the oiler/adjuster assemblies. Turned the beads down to size and roughed out the lower taper.
Sep 14, 2023 Cleaned up the lathe toolbox. Assembled the new tool trolley.
Sep 15, 2023 Rearranged the wood in the yard and moved the lathe a little for the tool trolley. Planed out the pieces to cut for the toolbox lid and started looking for pieces for the inner and lower trays.
Sep 16, 2023 Cut the 9 pieces for the lid of the lathe toolbox.
Sep 17, 2023 Re-drilled the bearing caps and tapped them M14. Drilled the oil holes in the top bearing shells. Oiler/adjusters are now functional.
Sep 18, 2023 Prepped face side and face edge of the pieces for the right hand section of the lathe toolbox lid.
Sep 19, 2023 Prepped the face side and face edge of the pieces for the left hand section of the lathe toolbox lid. Glued the 2 large pieces together.
Sep 20, 2023 Cut all the grooves for the end clamps. Cut one of the tongues and fitted the first end clamp piece. Stated Nhâm's hair dagger.
Sep 21, 2023 Cut the second tongue and glued the pieces of the left hand lid section together. Finished the hair dagger.
Sep 22, 2023 Cut the tongues for the second piece and glued it together.
Sep 23, 2023 Tried cutting some different moulding shapes to see which looks best.
Sep 24, 2023 Made the cutter shapes for the moulding I chose. Modified the scratch stock so it could hold the larger cutter.
Sep 25, 2023 Cut the first of the lid edges.
Sep 26, 2023 Marked out the remaining edge mouldings on the 2 main lid pieces and completed the mouldings on the right hand one.
Sep 27, 2023 Completed the mouldings.
Sep 28, 2023 Cut a new centre piece. The original was ½inch too short as I originally didn't plan to have a moulding on the back of the lid.
Sep 29, 2023 Cut the recesses and tongues where the outer lid pieces overlap the centre piece. Cut the recesses and fitted the hinges to the right hand lid.
Sep 30, 2023 Attached the right hand lid. Had to plug and redrill as it started off a fraction too far back. Next time I will only drill one hole per hinge until I get the alignment right.
Oct 1,  2023 Fitted the other lid pieces and started to trip the mouldings to match.
Oct 2,  2023 Cleaned up the lid and the mouldings. Scraped, sanded and oiled the outside of the box.
Oct 3,  2023 Turned the curved parts of the oiler/adjuster bodies.
Oct 4,  2023 Annealed one of the cheap chisels I bought and filed it to shape for a beading tool. Hardened and tempered it. Had to do it twice, first time it ended up blue. Just used the gas cooker. It's a bit slow, a more powerful flame would be better but works ok on small stuff like this.
Oct 5,  2023 Made a handle for the beading tool.
Oct 6,  2023 Turned the boss for the indexer arm. Turned out the beading tool wasn't hardened properly. Re-filed it and hardened it again. Seems ok now. Also made a point tool which seems to work ok. The tang was soft enough to file. Ground the pointy end. Drilled and tapped the side hole in the indexer boss.
Oct 7,  2023 Turned the finial for the indexer. Drilled and tapped the indexer point block.
Oct 8,  2023 Completed turning the indexer point, and blackened it. Drilled the hole in the headstock to attach it. Put some washers, nuts and a bolt in vinegar to remove the plating. Not sure about the nuts, they may be stainless.
Oct 9,  2023 Fitted the indexer and filed the first of the bearing oiler-adjusters.
Oct 10, 2023 Filed the second oiler-adjuster.
Oct 11, 2023 Rough turned the cap for the first of the oilers. Some problems getting it to screw all the way home. A bottoming tap would have been useful.
Oct 12, 2023 Finished turning the first oiler cap. It wont screw home in the second oiler, whereas a slightly longer bolt will. I guess that means the bolt has more clearance. This will be a whole lot easier to handle when I have screwcutting ability on the lathe.
Oct 14, 2023 Turned and threaded the lower part of the second oiler cap on the metal lathe. Pressure from the tailstock is a good way of keeping the die reasonably square. Started turning the curved top on the new lathe.
Oct 15, 2023 Completed the acorn top for the second oiler. Shaped the first of the wing nuts. Started filing the screwcutting section top piece.
Oct 16, 2023 Made carriers for ¾inch pipe and 10 ferrules.
Oct 17, 2023 Made a new retaining plate for the tool rest. The one I was using was a little too thick and the bolt didn't go all the way through the nut. I thought this might be the cause of the thread getting stiffer, although it may have just been dirt. Also had a tidy up. Too much junk accumulating on the bench from a series of small jobs. Starting to be difficult to find stuff...
Oct 18, 2023 Made a handle for the long 5.5mm drill bit.
Oct 19, 2023 Made a handle for the long ½inch drill bit. Made a norrow point tool.
Oct 20, 2023 Made a handle for the square ended scraper.
Oct 21, 2023 Made 2 handles, one for the broad point tool and one for the triangular scraper. Oiled the flywheel except for the largest groove.
Oct 22, 2023 Finished the edges of the top plate of the screw cutting section. Drilled matching holes in the headstock. Oiled the rest of the flywheel and the pulley. Not sure that was a good idea but it should be ok once the oil dries.
Oct 23, 2023 Cut the block for the screw cutting assembly to depth and width. Drilled the holes for the bolts and the pilot hole for the main shaft.
Oct 24, 2023 Completed the screwcutting assembly housing and reassembled the headstock.
Oct 25, 2023 Made an octagonal handle from stone rosewood.
Oct 26, 2023 Ground the 10mm T spanner to make a square taper. Fitted the handle. Hit it too hard and split it, but not too badly. I should know that it only needs gentle taps to fit a handle. If it doesn't go on far enough, hitting it harder will not help.
Oct 27, 2023 Cut out the marking knife tang.
Oct 28, 2023 Made a handle for the marking Knife.
Oct 29, 2023 Made a wooden cover for the toolrest base to keep the swarf out of the slot.
Oct 30, 2023 Cut some brass and steel tube to make the headstock shaft end cap.
Oct 31, 2023 Faced off the 2 tubes and turned down the brass to fit inside the steel tube. First one was a bit loose so I made another. Cut the slot to fit the flats on the shaft. Realised the senral hole was a little to small so opened it up with the boring bar.
Nov 1,  2023 Tried to solder the parts together but ran out of gas. The solder had started to flow so I decided to risk continuing, but the joint separated in the final stages of turning the outside.
Nov 2,  2023 Cut new pieces for the headstock shaft end cap. Turned the outside of the brass to fit inside the steel piece. Reversed the headstock shaft and turned the section between the M14 thread and the two flats down to the 15mm it should have been. Just used the graver, it seems to work fine on steel.
Nov 3,  2023 Filed the flats on the inside of the brass piece and soldered them together. Used 2 torches, and this may be more than necessary. I melted the brass a bit. Looks like it wont be a problem though. The end cap now fits on the shaft, I just need to clean it up.
Nov 8,  2023 Trying to make a hair spike for Nham.
Nov 9,  2023 Made a second hair spike.
Nov 13, 2023 Made a handle for the 10mm long drill bit.
Nov 18, 2023 Planed and sawed a 2½ inch square piece of the yellowish wood I used for the lathe frame. Rough turned it. This wood is very dense, 950kg per m³ or thereabouts which is similar to boxwood. I have polished the endgrain in the past, just to see what it looks like and it is potentialy a reasonable substitute. The colour isn't quite the same and the grain may be a little more open but it is worth a try if I can find any crack free pieces.
Nov 19, 2023 Cut the piece of stone rosewood into 2 sections for the body and head joints. Together they were too long for the lathe. Rough turned the body section.
Nov 20, 2023 Rough turned the head section. Got out all the old drills and started laying out tool trays for the lathe toolbox.
Nov 21, 2023 Prepared some pieces for the sides of the larger of the 2 tool trays.
Nov 22, 2023 Cut the box sides to length and marked out the dovetail tails..
Nov 23, 2023 Cut and cleaned up the tails, marked the pins and cut and fitted the first joint.
Nov 24, 2023 Cut and fitted the rest of the tails. Cut 2 pieces to make up the bottom of the box.
Nov 25, 2023 Made up some glue and glued the pieces of the bottom together. Cut some sides for the smaller tray.
Nov 26, 2023 Cut the bottom to size and added a taper to the sides of the rebate. Glued the tray together.
Nov 27, 2023 Cleaned up the tray and cut some strips to make the runners.
Nov 28, 2023 Made a handle for the small chuck, and used it to drill pilot holes for the runners.
Nov 29, 2023 Cut the pieces for the small tool tray to length and width ready for marking out the dovetails.
Nov 30, 2023 Marked out, cut and fitted all 4 joints.
Dec 1,  2023 Cut pieces for the bottom of the small tool tray and glued them together. Cut the rebates in the sides. Turns out the plough plane works just fine on its side and it is much easier to hold the small pieces that way. Trimmed the bottom to size.
Dec 2,  2023 Glued the small tray together.
Dec 3,  2023 Cleaned up the outside of the small tray.
Dec 4,  2023 Made a new flap for the bellows valve.
Dec 11, 2023 Made the blade of a knife for undercutting flute holes.
Dec 13, 2023 Made a handle for the undercutting knife.
Dec 14, 2023 Started making a handle for a d-bit drill
Dec 15, 2023 Completed the d-drill handle.
Dec 29, 2023 Made a document tube for the flute plans I got from the Paris Museum. Also rubbed down some tool handles and tool box surfaces where there seemed to be some mould growing.
Dec 31, 2023 Shortened the drive belt on the lathe. Rewired one of the flourescent light fittings for an LED tube.
Jan 8,  2024 Sorted through some of the extreme hardwood looking for pieces for a walking stick flute. I think this is higher priority than the Hotteterre.
Jan 9,  2024 Cut up a piece of stone rosewood that started as 3½in x 1½in. Thought long and hard about how to get a decent piece out of it avoiding holes on one edge and sapwood on the other. Gave up on the idea of getting 2 1½ in square pieces as that would have meant the only long piece had significant sapwood. Went for a slightly narrower piece with sapwood that will be fine for tool handles.
Jan 10, 2024 Drawing plans for a flute stick. I think I like the one based around a 3 piece design (actually 5 pieces counting the handle and spike).
Jan 11, 2024 Drilled the longest piece of Stone Rosewood. The drill came out off centre and with a curved bore but it should be ok. The D bit drill works well and I think I will try making a longer one from some of the smooth rebar I bought. The old bits cut ok but at least one of them needs the end re-making. Also there is not much room for sharpening with that design (end drilled out and cut to a U channel and then a slit made a short way down and the ends folded in) The design is good but I doubt it is worth the effort involved. I will see how a D bit handles long holes. Also thinking about rough reamers. I don't like the bent handle of the ½inch rough reamer and the thick section means it has a very negative cutting angle. I might regrind it so one face is on the diameter and only 2 edges cut rather than all 4 as per Jan Boertse's recommendations. Might just make a new one. The rough reamer is useful for correcting the curve in the bore I think. Maybe I should just start with a larger hole?
Jan 12, 2024 Machined the end of the ½inch long drill for a new handle. Started trying to make an 8mm thread but the drill is harder than the cheap die. Turned it down further and cut a 6mm thread on the end.
Jan 13, 2024 Turned a handle for the ½inch drill. Started to file the tail end of the drill square.
Jan 14, 2024 Finished off the square end on the ½inch drill and squared the mortice in the handle to fit.
Jan 15, 2024 Drilled the body section of the walking stick flute out to ½inch. The hole is now more central than it was with the original ¼inch hole. There is plenty wood left. Lesson: Smaller bits bend and can produce a curved hole. Most of the long drills I have do not leave a reliable centre to start a smaller hole at the bottom of a larger one. It may be necessary to do this so I need to consider how to locate the smaller drill inside the larger hole. Step drills or sleeves on a smaller drill are possibilities.
Jan 16, 2024 Reamed the body section. It is not complete, but making progress. The wood is finishing nicely. I will need to make some more reamers to complete it. The older of the 2 finish reamers is too steeply tapered and the newer one, although closer, is cracked and not really up to removing several mm. Reaming the whole length is too much anyway. The reamers seem to cut better when working on a shorter length. Ordered some 3mm HSS to make some new reamer blades, and a couple of 300mm long 14mm drills.
Jan 17, 2024 Cut a clean section from a badly cracked, warped, and worm eaten beam to make a morse taper holder so I can use the tailstock chuck from the metal lathe to hand drill flute bodies in the new lathe. Trued it up and cut to dimensions for turning. Also cut some notches to help the transition from round to rectangular. I can do this on the lathe but it is easy to split away the corners so this might make it safer.
Jan 18, 2024 Finished turning the morse taper handle and started making the steel plate to locate the end of the shaft.
Jan 19, 2024 Finished the locating plate and fitted it to the handle.
Jan 20, 2024 Started work on the reamer driver. Turned down some 14mm bar and cut a 10mm thread. Started filing the section below the thread into a square.
Jan 21, 2024 Finished squaring the driver shaft and cut the slot. Still needs widening a bit.
Jan 22, 2024 Finished cutting the slot and drilled and tapped the holes for the grub screws. Still need to straighten the slot and harden it.
Jan 23, 2024 Sawed 2 20inch sides of a 1½ inch square from the same badly worm eaten baulk as the morse taper holder. Turned drilled and morticed the handle for the reamer driver. Hardened the steel part and assembled it all.
Jan 24, 2024 Ground a piece of 18x3x200 HSS to a taper for the top end of the body piece of a 3 piece flute, based on the measurements from Ardal Powells article on the Hotettere flutes. 18mm to 16mm over 200mm. (Probably good for the left hand piece of a 4 piece flute too)
Jan 26, 2024 Started making the long reamer holder. Turned and threaded the end and sawed the square. Using the hacksaw was fiddly, but probably saved me a day of filing. The offcuts were less than 1mm thick.
Jan 27, 2024 Finished the square end of the long reamer holder and made and fittesd a handle.
Jan 28, 2024 Cut the slot in the end of the long reamer holder. Using a piece of HSS as a cold chisel works quite well, although I don't think grinding it at an angle helped much. Both edges still cut, even though one had a significantly negative cutting angle.
Jan 29, 2024 Drilled and tapped the holes for the grub screws in the long reamer holder. Started grinding the 14mm-16mm reamer blade.
Jan 30, 2024 Completed the 14-16 reamer blade and hardened the long handle end.
Jan 31, 2024 Used the 2 new reamers to rough finish the centre joint bore of the flute stick. I say "rough" as in not done. The surface is pretty smooth, just perhaps a little more to be removed once I cut the piece to its final length.
Feb 2,  2024 Cut the headjoint piece to lengthand set it up for drilling.
Feb 3,  2024 Made a 10mm d-bit.
Feb 4,  2024 Drilled the headjoint. Hardened and tempered the 10mm bit. It was working but seemed to need a lot of pressure. This was improved by grinding the top surface. I think this is due to the size of the remaining part of the circle rather than the very slight cutting angle created by the curve of the grinding wheel. Although it cuts better now I may take a little more off. I don't think it should require much pressure to make it cut. The hole in the headjoint was pretty accurate. Not easy to measure but I think it was about 0.4mm off centre at the exit end, over a length of around 320mm.
Feb 5,  2024 Bored the headjoint out using the 2 flat drills. It's now around 17mm. Looks like the sequence will be 10mm D-bit to establish a good pilot hole followed by 14mm and 17mm flat bits. 12mm twist bits may also be useful but the home made bits with the folded over ends will probably be retired or recut as d-bits. They were an attempt to make a shell bit substitute and although they worked reasonably well I think easy sharpening is important and they soon sharpen to nothing plus they don't offer much, if anything, over d-bits.
Feb 6,  2024 Rounded off the wide end of the 16mm-18mm reamer and put it through the headjoint.
Feb 16, 2024 Cut a piece of wood for the new carrier. Drilled it most of the way through at 2⅛in and used the hole to mount it on the lathe. Started to turn out the recess for the bearing.
Feb 17, 2024 Completed the recess for the bearing and cut some strips of steel to hold it in place.
Feb 18, 2024 Turned the face of the bearing support block, trimmed the lower end so the bearing lines up with the lathe centres, and cut the recesses for the metal retaining plates.
Feb 19, 2024 Drilled the holes in the bearing mounting block and fitted the retainers and the 2 countersink inserts.
Mar 4,  2024 Made the front rail for the keyboard stand.
Apr 8,  2024 Finished reshaping the dovetails saw handle.
Apr 19, 2024 Cut a piece of wood for the front of the mini drawer for the imperial spanners.
Apr 20, 2024 Cut the remaining pieces of the spanner drawer and cut the grooves for the base.
Apr 21, 2024 Marked out, cut, and fitted the dovetails. Cut the base to size.
Apr 22, 2024 Fitted the handle to the spanner drawer and assembled it. Cut some stock for the other 2 drawers.
Apr 24, 2024 Made a dovetail gauge and marked out the tails for the second drawer. Cut the groove for the bottom.
Apr 25, 2024 Cut and fitted the 4 joints for the second drawer.
Apr 26, 2024 Completed the 2nd drawer.
Apr 27, 2024 Cut pieces for the 3rd drawer. Cut the groove and marked out the tails.
May 1,  2024 Cut the tails, glued up a crack in one of the sides and glued the two parts of the base together.
May 2,  2024 Fitted the joints, added the handle and glued up the 3rd drawer.
May 12, 2024 Drawing up plans for a flute can after Naust E:710
May 16, 2024 Made an 18-20 tapered reamer blade. Reamed the head joint and the body out to approximately the correct size.
May 18, 2024 Drew an exaggerated bore profile ready for fine adjustments of the reamers/bore.
May 22, 2024 Selected a piece of scrap for a carrier for the body of the new flute.
May 23, 2024 Turned taper on the carrier. I had misjudged the length, it was too short. Found another piece and turned a taper on it. Still a bit large, the flute section doesn't go all the way on yet. Both pieces had a nail in them that wasn't obvious to the eye. Removed them by turning down either side leaving a rough bead containing the nail, then cut away a bit of the bead so I could get hold of the nail with the pincers.
May 24, 2024 Completed the carrier for the flute body.
May 25, 2024 Turned the outside of the flute body so it is concentric with the bore. Still oversize.
May 27, 2024 Added a reinforcing wire to the square cup chuck. Turned some of the remaining old cup chucks to fit the brass cup chuck, including the small square cup chuck.
May 28, 2024 Turned 2 plug centres, 20mm and 20.3mm
May 29, 2024 Made a plug chuck for the headjoint. Turned the outside of the headjoint. Its about 36mm now.
May 30, 2024 Turned a piece for the joint between the head and body of the flute. Drilled a hole through it, up to 17.5mm using various drill bits. Finished off with the mt4 17.5. It was grabbing badly so I reground it to have less of an angle. Also reground some old long flat drills. It looks like the simple D bits are the best and I will probably make at least one more, a 14mm. Regrinding the 10mm I managed to mess up the grinding wheel. It's probably not a good idea to leave the bit in the heavy hand chuck as it bounced and dinged the wheel. Spent some time tweaking the grinder and it is working ok but would benefit from dressing the wheels.
Jun 1,  2024 Started work on the Burns faceplate. I think I can see how to make it work. Cut a piece of scrap steel for a reinforcing plate and marked out a piece of ebony to replace the broken corner. The fretboard is very worn and there is not much of the frets left. I will put it together and try it out, I always did like the low frets. If it has buzzing problems I guess it will be time for a refret...
Jun 2,  2024 Cut a piece of ebony to replace the broken corner. Hollowed out the recess a bit more so there is no pressure on the jack socket. Added 2 more holes for screws. Glued the pieces together, including the steel reinforcing plate. Started shaping the new piece.
Jun 3,  2024 Completed the repair to the Burns scratchplate and reassembled it. Had to take it apart again to clean the toggle switch, but now it works well.
Jun 4,  2024 Started enlarging the hole in the flute piece that joins the head and body. The hole is about 1inch in diameter and almost 3 inches deep. Probably could do it just with turning tools, but making a reamer and using that will be easier and less prone to disaster. Ordered some more HSS.
Jun 6,  2024 Cut a piece of brass for the tailstock bolt head. Drilled and tapped it to 14mm.
Jun 7,  2024 Turned a 14mm bolt to make a screw chuck adapter for the 4 jaw chuck. Started grinding the 25mm reamer for the hole in the piece between the head and body joints of the flute.
Jun 8,  2024 Completed grinding the 25mm reamer. I may have made the angle a little steeper than necessary. Started making a handle to drive it. The ones I already have are for 3mm HSS reamer blades, and this is 4mm. Cut a piece of 20mm steel rod for this. 20mm wont go into the headstock shaft bore so I will need to use the tailstock to support the free end when I turn it down for the threaded section. I had cut it too long to fit in the lathe, maximum it can handle when using the back centre is only about 5 inches. Had to remove about 1.5 inches. All set up ready to turn the end for the thread now.
Jun 9,  2024 Turned the 4mm reamer holder shank down and cut a thread on the last section.
Jun 10, 2024 Cut the square section that will locate in the handle. Filed the first flat, took about 600 strokes of the file. Cut the others with the hacksaw. Its good practice for accurate sawing and saves quite a lot of work.
Jun 11, 2024 Cut the slot for the blade. Used a hacksawfor the sides and the piercing saw with a fine blade to cut across the bottom. Managed to do it without breaking the blade or resorting to wobbling the waste piece to get it to separate. Still had to file a bit off the sides, but at least I have a file that will fit in the 4mm slot, unlike the earlier versions for 3mm reamer blades. For those I had had to use the HSS as a cold chisel.
Jun 12, 2024 Turned the wooden part of the reamer handle.
Jun 13, 2024 Turned the bolt head for the tailstock securing bolt. Fitted a piece of threaded rod and added some temporary handles using a 6mm countersunk machine screw and one of the handles from the broken tap driver. The brass head was all turned by hand mostly using the lilac handled graver. Also used the beading tool and the parting tool. It would be good to have a smaller beading tool but I'm not sure how I would cut it. It would need a very small mousetail file.
Jun 14, 2024 Started on the handles for the headstock securing bolt.
Jun 16, 2024 Completed the small handle.
Jun 17, 2024 Made some ferrules.
Jun 18, 2024 Completed the large handle for the tailstock securing bolt. Cut a piece of brass tube to make a sleeve for the toolrest securing bolt. Forgot to account for the wooden cross piece at the bottom so it was initially too long. Now I have a piece that will probably be perfect to replace the 4 washers on the large reamer. The toolrest is now easier to move around with one hand.
Jun 19, 2024 Hardened the large reamer handle and turned the piece of brass to replace the 4 washers.
Jun 20, 2024 Turned the inside of the joint piece of the flute. It was very slightly triangular (constant diameter) and probably a little small. It's now circular and 26mm diameter which will allow for 3mm tenon thickness in the head and body pieces. I turned it using the 1/4inch square scraper tool, while holding it in the 4 jaw chuck.
Jun 21, 2024 Made a carrier for the joint piece. I had hoped it would be stable enough held between a cup chuck and the tailstock but the joint piece rocks slightly and the carrier turned out to be very slightly eccentric. I think it may be partly because I used one of the larger cup chucks and it doesn't seat perfectly. Maybe I should stick with the brass cup chuck. Also I will try making a plug chuck and back centre as I did for the head joint. That way the bore can be supported at both ends and hopefully not rock.
Jun 25, 2024 Started making a new carrier which will fit in the brass cup chuck. Locates well and almost turned down to size.
Jun 26, 2024 Finished the carrier and started turning a piece for the backcentre to support the other end of the flute joint piece.
Jun 27, 2024 Completed the backcentre. I turned the outer end down to a close fit, then used that as a visual guide to turn the inner section down to the same size. Almost got it right first try, but I had left a smaller diameter section that fitted in a small cup chuck so I could skim it down to a perfect fit. Had to cut that off once it fitted, there is not enough room between the plug chuck and the back centre to keep it.
Jun 28, 2024 Made a ⅛inch beading tool
Jul 1,  2024 Made the handle for the beading tool. Hardenned and tempered the steel. Not sure the temper quite reached far enough. The straw colour may not have reached the tip. Lets see if it breaks in use.
Jul 2,  2024 Trued up the Outside of the flute joint section and marked it out for turning to shape.
Jul 3,  2024 Made a small ¼ circle ⅛inch lathe tool, including the handle, and hardening and tempering.
Jul 4,  2024 Turned the joint piece to its final profile. The beadings were easier than expected, although I did have a little trouble with breakout on the centre beading. The ¼ circle tool seems to work better than the beading tool, which is closer to a semi-circle. I might grind it back a little. I think the trapping effect of the 2 side points is not helpful. I had forgotten how tedious sanding can be...
Jul 5,  2024 Cut and rough turned a piece for the handle end of the head joint of the flute.
Jul 8,  2024 Cut a piece off the edge of some 30x4mm HSS to make a 25-28 reamer.
Jul 9,  2024 Ground the new reamer.
Jul 10, 2024 Drilled and reamed the piece for the handle end of the head joint.
Jul 16, 2024 Turned a carrier for the latest flute piece.
Jul 17, 2024 Turned the headjoint handle end piece and sanded it.
Jul 18, 2024 Turned the headjoint down to roughly the final size and fitted the handle end piece. Not glued yet, still considering what glue to use. There seems to be a flaw in the outer end, so I had to proceed extremely carefully. The obvious part is covered by the end piece so it should be ok.
Jul 19, 2024 Glued the handle end piece on and turned the tenon for the body end joint. Glued that on too.
Jul 22, 2024 Drilled the embouchure using the drill press on its fastest speed. Turned the headjoint to its final size and sanded it.
Jul 23, 2024 Turned the body down a little and turned the tenon to fit in the headjoint. There is a crack but it should be ok as this joint is to be glued.
Jul 24, 2024 Rough turned the extra stock for the handle and footjoint. Cut off a section for the handle and the footjoint. Turned the footjoint to fit the carrier and bored it out to ½ inch.
Jul 30, 2024 Tweaked the tenon at the head end of the body so it fits close against the shoulder without leaving an internal gap. Turned the footjoint end tenon to fit. Marked and drilled the fingerholes.c
Jul 31, 2024 Made a tuning knife from an offcut of the flute cane joint pieces and a short length of ¼inch silver steel.
Aug 1,  2024 Sharpened the tuning knife and used it to undercut the holes. It works much better on the smaller holes. I will need to make another larger one. Turned the flute body down to size and sanded it.
Aug 2,  2024 Made the metal part of the new tuning knife. Turned down the end of the old flat drill and cut a thread on it in preparation for fitting a handle.
Aug 3,  2024 Made the handle for the new tuning knife. Hardened and tempered the steel part, and fitted the handle. Sharpened it.
Aug 4,  2024 Made a handle for the old flat drill. Marked out the tail end of the drill for filing it square using the index holes on the back of the 4 jaw chuck.
Aug 5,  2024 Squared off the tail end of the old flat drill and fitted the handle. Turned the foot mortice a bit deeper and turned the tenon to fit perfectly.
Aug 6,  2024 cleaned up the headstock pulley boss a little, turning it in place. Started cutting a piece of brass for the index plate. Cut the first quarter with the piercing saw and fret saw using the coarser blades (about 16tpi). Managed to break one so I tried using the hacksaw. Turns out the hacksaw will cut a curve of this radius (just).
Aug 7,  2024 Finished cutting out the brass disk for the indexing plate. Made a faceplate. Already had the brass boss, cut the wooden disk and fitted the boss.
Aug 8,  2024 Trued up the faceplate. Started investigating layout methods for marking the holes in the indexing disc.
Aug 9,  2024 Marked out and drilled 5 holes in the indexing disc. Mounted it on the faceplate. The centre mark ended up very slightly off centre. Cleaning it up and recentering the mark was not easy. A small hole would be fine, but a centre point is difficult to turn. Got there close enough with a combination of abrasive paper and the very small graver. It might have been easier just to rely on the circular scratch marks to define the centre. It is only needed for marking out the radial lines. The circles will be done using the lathe.
Aug 12, 2024 Marked out the 24 hole ring on the indexing disc. Blacked out the extra lines in preparation for marking out the 36 hole ring.
Aug 13, 2024 Marked out the 36 hole ring. I made a tomahawk trisection tool out of a piece of clear plastic that came from a pack of individual butter pieces and used it to divide each 60° angle into 3. There appeared to be a tiny discrepancy in some of the 60° angles, as the tomahawk didn't always sit at exactly the same radius. It's interesting considering how to mark things like this out accurately. Getting a "second opinion" seems valuable, ie trisecting opposite angles and looking for inaccuracies by comparing them using the centre of the circle as a reference point. Marked out the 14 hole ring using a different method. This time I did the preparation on paper, marking a line with 7 equal steps and using the second mark to find the intersection of the circumference with the end of the first side of a pentagon. Steping the length of the side around the circle gives the angles. Scribing the same diameter circle on the brass and stepping the side length around the circumference gives the angles which can then be projected onto the circle with the desired diameter. Using the centre and each vertex and projecting the line back to the opposite side of the circle gives the other 7 points.
Aug 16, 2024 Marked out the 26 hole ring. This one was a bitch. Had to divide a circle into 13, and that is a lot of steps to multiply any error. It took many goes at stepping around the circle, which I did on paper. Then I doubled that up by starting from the opposite end of the diameter. That gave me 3 points for every diameter I needed to merk, and a chance to spot any errors. There were some which I tweaked.  Once that was right I tried marking out the circle on the brass disc, but still needed a few tries to get the distance to step around the circle right.
Aug 17, 2024 Marked out the 10 hole ring using the same method as the 26 hole ring. Punched the 26 and 10 hole rings and drilled them all. Turned out the centre and started to clean up the burrs ready for fitting to the pulley.
Aug 18, 2024 Finished cleaning up the burrs on the back of the index plate. The hole was a fraction too small so I had to re-chuck it and open it out. # times. Each time meant dismantling the headstock bearings and shaft. Fits nicely and is screwwed on in place ready for final cleanup.
Aug 19, 2024 Cleaned up the dividing plate, sanded it to 1000. Cut the shape of the rear bearing adjuster wingnut.
Aug 20, 2024 Turned down the foot joint a bit and marked out the various features on it.
Aug 21, 2024 Turned the main diameter of the foot joint down leaving the various beadings square.
Aug 22, 2024 Established the features of the foot joint. The lower part is close to final size but the key mount part still needs to be reduced further.
Aug 23, 2024 Reduced the keymount part further.
Aug 27, 2024 Drilled the key hole and the side vent hole. Realised I had missread the plans, and what I thought were hole sizes were actually the inside end of the undercutting. This means I will need to bush every hole as they are all too large, including the embouchure. Adjusted the mouldings on the foot joint and sanded it. The bottom 2 notes are within reach of where they should be.
Aug 28, 2024 Found a piece to make the hole inserts. Resharpened the rip saw and cut a long square. Started turning it round ready for the inserts.
Aug 30, 2024 Drilled out the flute holes a little, so that the sides were parallel (I had started undercutting them when testing the tuning knives). Turned inserts for each and glued them in place (superglue). Cleaned up inside and outside. Outside was easy, but inside was a little tricky. Considered making a long chisel out of a piece of 14mm round steel bar, but ended up using the reamers, and carefully controlling the depth so I could scrape away at the upstream end of each plug. Alowing the reamer to enter even a fraction of a millimter too far would cause the reamer to stick against the side of the plug. Had to be really careful. Any force aplied would risk loosening a plug.
Aug 31, 2024 Drilled the fingerholes again. Started at 3.5mm and used a small file to make adjustments so the holes were concentric with the plugs. Drilled every hole to the nearest drill size below the specified size. Tried playing it and it is almost ok. Some of the 3rd octave is not there or not right.
Sep 1,  2024 Started opening up the tone holes and undercutting them. The angled tuning knife is the only one small enough to do the smaller holes, and it is not so easy to use. Made a small straight tuning knife from a broken 5mm drill.
Sep 2,  2024 Did some more tuning.
Sep 3,  2024 Made the handle piece.
Sep 5,  2024 Made a 4mm tuning knike, and fitted a handle to the 3.5mm drill bit with the bent shank.
Sep 6,  2024 Designed and made the key for the flute.
Sep 9,  2024 Cut the slot for the key and fitted it. Drilling was tricky, couldn't work out a way to do it with precision, just had to guess and do it mostly by eye. Drilled the wood straight through, then drilled one side of the key. Pinned that side and drilled the other side of the key. Filed the excess off the key boss so it rotates on the pin ok. Seems to have worked out.
Sep 10, 2024 Added a spring and a pad to the key. Had to redo it and it still isn't working great. The bottom D is there but sometimes need to press on the key. It may bed in with time and I have left it with extra pressure from a hair band to help that.
Sep 11, 2024 Key is working a little better, and I can see the imprint of the hole in the leather. Sanded the head and foot sections again. It wont be so easy to do once the pieces are glued together.
Sep 13, 2024 glued the sections together. Found some more spring steel that is double the thickness of the current spring. Will use that to make a new spring if the key doesn't work right. Need to wait and see. I think it will improve more with time (and oiling?)
Sep 14, 2024 Marked out a long section of 14mm rod for a reamer holder.
Sep 16, 2024 Cut the slot for the reamer blades, drilled and tapped holes for the screws. tried using it held in the vice, but it is not so easy and a little too short. Turned a 10 section on the end and threaded it and marked out and started cutting the square for a handle.
Sep 17, 2024 Finished cutting the square and made a handle. Used the indexing wheel to mark out 10 sides on the centre section and planed them flat. Fitted the handle.
Sep 18, 2024 Oiled the bore of the flute.
Sep 19, 2024 tried tuning the flute. High f is proving dificult to get. Pushing the cork out makes it work, but it is still very flat.
Sep 20, 2024 Played the flute some more. Either it is geting better or I am getting used to it. Still not easy to hit the lowest note fast. Needs very precise positioning, and the size of it is tending to either move the embouchure out of alignment or partially uncover the lowest hole. Got to stretch...
Sep 21, 2024 Cleared the bench to try fixing the 12 string. Will attempt glueing it in place first, and if that fails, remove the neck and rebuild the heel.
Sep 23, 2024 Drilled the end plug of the flute and tapped it for the hammer head insert that will be the boot. Filed and sanded the key. Replaced the spring with a thicker one. Replaced the pad, skin surface down this time. Getting the lowest note was getting easier, even with the weak spring and the pad skin side up. Only remaining problem is that high F natural (12-45--). It sounds well enough but is so flat it is almost the same as the high E (12--567)
Sep 24, 2024 Glued the heel of the 12-string. Used a sash cramp clamped in the vice to provide downward pressure. More experiments with the walking stick flute. Still having trouble with f'''# but the tone is getting really nice.
Sep 26, 2024 Fitted a piece of water pipe to the bike so I can carry the flute stick.
Sep 27, 2024 Finished turning the foot of the flute stick. It was a little large and had a longtitudonal convex curve that didn't look quite right. Discovered a crack in the head where the handle fits. Considering how best to fix it. Probably pinning will do it. If not I might need to add a brass ring.
Sep 28, 2024 Reconsiderd fixing the crack. Replacing the final beading with a brass ring makes more sense. The flute is longer than the lathe bed though. Planning a lathe bed extension. It would need to be 12 inches to use the tailstock, but I could use the carrier on a shorter extension, maybe 4-6 inches. This could just be 2 blocks with a hole for the bolts that currently secure the bedways to the frame, with longer bolts to go through the extension.
Sep 29, 2024 Rethink of the lathe extension, something bolted to the top ill be easier and quicker. This is probably best as a temporary fixture with re-useable parts. Located a piece for the main bar.
Sep 30, 2024 Planed the extension piece to thickness and width, located a piece for the upright.
Oct 1,  2024 Drilled the boltholes and fitted the screwed inserts.
Oct 2,  2024 Completed the lathe bed estension, including tuning down a nut to make a slim nut and turning a point on some threaded rod. Recessed the bolt heads as I want to be able to slide the thing onto the bed without removing it, so it doesn't interfere with access to the door. Cut a piece of brass to make a ring for the flute.
Oct 3,  2024 Trimmed the brass to size and length. It ended up 100mm long. Annealled and hammered it into a circle. Soldered the joint. Hammered it to perfect the circle, then turned and sanded the outside.
Oct 4,  2024 Fitted the ring and sanded the flute.
Oct 7,  2024 Bit more testing and tuning. Opened up the lowest hole so the Bb notes are ok.
Oct 17, 2024 Turned a piece of brass for the screwcutting guide.
Oct 18, 2024 Fitted the guide to the headstock shaft.
Oct 22, 2024 Cut the thread on the screwcutting guide. Reassembled the headstock. Thread is not as even as I would like, there is skill needed to cut these well I think. Not bad for a first attempt, and hopefully good enough to work. Cutting a second one should be easier as I will be able to use the regular toolrest rather than the makeshift one bolted to the headstock. Cutting other pitches will be similarly tricky unless I can devise a jig to both mount the screwcutting guide blank and the master thread in the usual position.
Oct 23, 2024 Annealed a chisel blank and started filing it to make a 16tpi thread chaser. Marked the teeth out using a 16TPI tap and used a triangular file and a cold chisel to shape the teeth. Not easy and required many iterations but it is reasonably close when checked against the tap.
Oct 31, 2024 Cleaned up the screwcutting guide with the new thread chaser.
Nov 1,  2024 Made a stand for the windsynth.
Nov 4,  2024 Made a bike carrier for the windsynth.
Nov 6,  2024 Converted bike carrier into a sling carrier.
Nov 8,  2024 Made the end plugs and locating pins for the carrier. It is now reasonably well sealed when it is closed. When it was mounted on the bike it was only closed at each end witha bolt so it could not collect water.
Nov 12, 2024 Turned a split nut driver from an old 122mm bolt. Took 3 tries to get it right.
Nov 13, 2024 Filed up the tang of the nut driver, Turned a handle for it and gave it seven sides. Filed the points on the end and enlarged the slot in the hurdy gurdy axle bush a little.
Nov 14, 2024 Eased the bearings of the hurdy gurdy a little. Still a bit stiffer than I would like.
Nov 26, 2024 Prepared a blank for the gurdy crank handle. Had to cut the corners off by hand, the large flat chuck jaws wouldn't quite grip it, and the medium ones wouldn't open quite far enough.
Nov 28, 2024 Rough turned the gurdy handle blank and drilled a 10mm hole through it.
Nov 29, 2024 Drilled the hole larger so the brass bush was a close fit. Reamed it so there was a taper where the bush would not be and turned a carrier to fit. Turned and sanded the handle shape and pushed the brass bush in.
Dec 4,  2024 Cut a piece of wood for the gurdy wheel. Mounted it on the wooden faceplate using woodscrews into the corners just outside the size of the finished wheel. Turned the hole for the mounting bush and turned the outside edge slightly oversize.
Dec 20, 2024 Cut a circular piece of woodfor the base of the yarn holder. Drilled out the five screw holes in the faceplate so I could secure it from the back, and turned it to a very short cylinder shape.
Jan 15, 2025 Marked out circle for the top piece of the yarn holder. Madea base for the desk light.
Jan 16, 2025 Added the spindle and assembled the top piece of the yarm holder. Used an offcut of the stainless steel rod to temporarily plug the hole and act as a bearing. Will replace it after testing as it is easy to push it up and cause the 2 parts to rub.
Feb 5,  2025 Modified the string lock on my guitar. The low E string still sharpens when locking the string, but the rest is pretty close. Added fret markers at 5 and 12 on the edge of the fingerboard by drilling 2mm holes and filling them with ebony sanding dust and superglue.
Feb 6,  2025 Tidied up and oiled the lathe. Looked over the hurdy gurdy plans with a view to finding stock for the neck and head.
Feb 21, 2025 Cut a length of wood for the neck and keybox of the gurdy. Setup the kerfing plane at 5/16inch for the neck and keybox planks.
Feb 24, 2025 Cut the first kerf.
Feb 25, 2025 Cut the first 2 planks and the third kerf.
Feb 26, 2025 Cut 2 more planks.
Feb 28, 2025 Cut 1 more plank.
Mar 4,  2025 Cut 1 more plank.
Mar 5,  2025 Cut 1 more plank.
Mar 12, 2025 Cut the last 2 planks.
Mar 18, 2025 Cut out the paper template for the Hurdy Gurdy headstock
Mar 19, 2025 Attempted to fix the midi keyboard. Seems to be ok as far as the wheels go now, but aftertouch still doesn't work. Looks like it is a sensor problem.. SHorting the connections out does send aftertouch so the circuit board is ok.
Mar 24, 2025 Started trying to create a physical modelling synth in VCV-Rack
Mar 25, 2025 Experimenting with midi from python to use with the 3d mouse. Can read input and identify IO ports.
Mar 26, 2025 Can now output midi from python.
Apr 1,  2025 Sending midi CC message from 3d mouse movement.
Apr 3,  2025 Gave up on the idea of hollowing the hurdy gurdy pegbox before separating it from the baulk. I had thought this would help hold it together when cutting the recess, but decided the complexity overruled the possible benefits. Cut the piece, planed the end surface and marked it out for the neck and keybox slots and the sloping top piece. I intend to cut it in 2, hollow the lower part and glue the top piece back on. If I do it right the join should be barely visible.
Apr 4,  2025 Cut the pegbox into two, planed up the matching surfaces, cut the grooves for the neck and keybox, and marked the lower piece out ready for drilling.
Apr 16, 2025 Cut the recess in the pegbox. Started by drilling it out, followed by carpenters gouge and then a large half-round file
Apr 17, 2025 Fitted new hoses for the garden and yard. Glued up the small piece that split off the pegbox while sanding it.
Apr 18, 2025 A little more sanding of the gurdy pegbox recess.
Apr 25, 2025 A little more sanding of the gurdy pegbox recess.
Apr 28, 2025 Finished sanding the inside of the pegbox and glued the top layer back on. Cramping it was a problem, until I set it up in the vice with packing pieces so the join was approximately parallel to the vice faces.
Apr 29, 2025 Cut the outside of the pegbox. First cut the top and bottom tapers, leaving the centre uncut so I could still use the faces to hold it while cutting the curved sides. Once the sides were removed, the top and bottom cuts were completed.
Apr 30, 2025 Rearanging the workshop to make use of the old kitchen drainer. Really need some taller shelves though.
May 9,  2025 Cleaned up and sharpened the lute peg reamer.
May 14, 2025 Planed 2 pieces of lacewood to thickness for the lower neck of the gurdy. Marked them out to cut to shape. Drilled pilot holes for the tuning pegs and did a bit more shaping of the head.
Jul 14, 2025 Cut 3 bakelite panels and assembled the frame for the midi controller.
Jul 15, 2025 Turned a replacement peg for the windsynth case lid and glued them both in. Turned a peg for Pens coatrack.
Oct 9,  2025 Cleaned up the workshop a bit and replaced the moulding on the front door that Chili chewed.
Oct 10, 2025 Turned another peg for Pen's coat rack. Started thinking about making a small square chuck. It will be usefull for the last peg. Found a piece of brass to use.
Oct 14, 2025 Cut a piece of brass for the small square chuck. Faced it and drilled and tapped the centre hole. Used a boring bar to cut the shoulder relief. This meant changing the shims on the toolpost. Used the thick aluminium spacers under the toolpost and the 2 brown painted steel shims under the boring bar. The 2 steel spacers need to go back under the general purpose tool, and the U shaped spacer needs to replace the 2 thick aluminium spacers under the toolpost to return it to general purpose use.
Oct 15, 2025 Turned an inside taper on the square chuck. Turns out the edge of an hss square does a pretty good job of this.
Nov 4,  2025 Cut some pieces for Nhâm's tapestry frame.
Nov 5,  2025 Cut the second piece to width and marked out both. drilled the holes and fitted one of the joints.
Nov 6,  2025 Cut everything to length and fitted the other 3 joints.
Nov 17, 2025 Moved lots of tools upstairs and raised the toolchest in prparation for flooding.
Nov 18, 2025 Dismantled the WX5 to fix the bite sensor range. It's now working againbut I don't know what I changed. There doesn't appear to be a spring returning the lever to the low position, it must be the shape of the rubber boot that does this.
Dec 3, 2025 Cleaning continues. Been doing little else since we got home. Was that a week ago? Starting to plan how to rearrange tool storage. Although the carpenters tool chest is excellent for accessibility, its not good for mobility. If the floods come there is no way I can carry it upstairs. It is also very much all in one. It might make more sense to have multiple smaller toolboxes for specific purposes. First one would be the lathe toolbox for chucks and turning tools, second would be for flute drills and reamers. Not sure how to divide up the rest. There would need to be a general purpose toolbox I think. Maybe one for drilling holes and one for basic joinery (saws, marking guages and squares). One for metalwork with files and hacksaws.

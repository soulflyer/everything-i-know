Got my blessings from a death diviner
Cut my shackles with the force of life
That slipped away
Oh, and left me drained
Fox-feline furs and cane room dividers
Huddling silently until her ghost
Was whisked away
Oh, but I remained

When the skies remained an empty threat above me
But the weight of everything that came to pass
Brought me down to kneel before the death diviner
In the hope that she would make me free at last

Saw my future with the death diviner
My reflection in her eyes drew up
My twisted past
Oh, I came unmasked

When the skies remained an empty threat above me
But the weight of everything that came to pass
Brought me down to kneel before the death diviner
In the hope that she would make me free at last

When the skies remained an empty threat above me
But the weight of everything that came to pass
Brought me down to kneel before the death diviner
In the hope that she would make me free at last

I don't mind
If my heart don't beat and
the sun don't shine
They'll get theirs
You'll get yours and I'll get mine
It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

I'm alright

Am I made of steel
Am I locked up tight
I'm human
But I'm wide awake and afraid to fight
It used to take nothing to amaze me
But now I'm older and
it doesn't even phase me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

It used to be that everything was easy
Now it's lost and nobody believes me

Am I losing heart
Have I frozen it, oh yeah
Am I pushing too hard
Have I started to forget

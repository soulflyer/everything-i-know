Kaisarion
A prophecy told
We're building our empire
From the ashes of an old
Kaisarion
The fruit of the womb
Our brotherhood of good faith
Sealed an apostate witch's doom

It's the sound of another deadline
Whistling past your ears
It's the sight of a million regrets
Mounting over years
It's the words that were never spoken
That echoes through the times
It's the smell of the burning temples
Swept away by rhymes

(Hypatia)
Far away from the stench of the heavens
(Hypatia)
Long ago yet too close to forever
(Hypatia)
When a paradise is lost go straight to

Kaisarion
A matter of love
When mother earth is calling
For a father up above
Kaisarion
Put on the smiles
And throw your holy rocks right at her
For her satanic wiles

It's the truth of candour shown
Through a prism of deceit
It's the continence of bishops
With their choirboys en suite
It's the tongue soiled in adulation
That licks to no avail
It's the noise of the righteous dogma
That hides the handmaid's tail

(Hypatia)
Far away from the stench of the heavens
(Hypatia)
Long ago yet too close to forever
(Hypatia)
When a paradise is lost, go straight to

It's the sound of another deadline
Whistling past your ears
It's the sight of a million regrets
Mounting over years
It's the words that were never spoken
That echoes through the times
It's the smell of the burning temples
Swept away by rhymes

It's the truth of candour shown
Through a prism of deceit
It's the continence of bishops
With their choirboys en suite
It's the tongue soiled in adulation
That licks to no avail
It's the noise of the righteous dogma
That hides the handmaid's tail

(Hypatia)
Far away from the stench of the heavens
(Hypatia)
Long ago yet too close to forever
(Hypatia)
When a paradise is lost go straight to
(Hypatia)
Far away from the stench of the heavens
(Hypatia)
Long ago yet too close to forever
(Hypatia)
When a paradise is lost go straight to

I long for silence
A cold embrace
A sheltered place
Where my past is erased
You know I miss you
You don't know how
Eternal pain
In the blink of an eye

And now I'm hurtling
Towards the void
All for a bond that can't be destroyed

And it's haunting me
What we used to be
Like a ghost in me
Whispering endlessly
And you know I would
If I only could
Be electric
Electric again

I sense the currents
A feathered touch
A heightened sense
Where your fingers once brushed
I serve no master
But still I'm drawn
To where life breaks
As it enters the dawn

And now I'm hurtling
Towards the void
All for a bond that can't be destroyed

And it's haunting me
What we used to be
Like a ghost in me
Whispering endlessly
And you know I would
If I only could
Be electric
Electric again

And now I'm hurtling
Towards the void
All for a bond that can't be destroyed

And it's haunting me
What we used to be
Like a ghost in me
Whispering endlessly
And you know I would
If I only could
Be electric
Electric again

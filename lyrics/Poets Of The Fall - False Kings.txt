  Getting lost singing their song, woa oh oh oh, Caught up in all I've done, oh
Bm                                 A              G                   F#  Em     F# 
   It's all I know, but not what I need, Oh oh oh oh, Cut by my love, cut till I bleed
             Bm
So I want to run to your shelter tonight
A
Run to the shelter tonight
G
United in silent resistance
   F#   e          d c# 
Of bowing to false kings
So let me run to your shelter tonight
Run from this meaningless pantomime
I'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence
Of bowing to false kings

Bought their smiles, liquid and smooth, (exhale)
Took their words for the truth, hey
Edge of light and shade, woa oh oh oh
My broken soul once more enslaved

So I want to run to your shelter tonight
Run to the shelter tonight
United in silent resistance
Of bowing to false kings
So let me run to your shelter tonight
Run from this meaningless pantomime
I see the false kings
I see that all this
Must end

                Em
When there's no love in my embrace
     F#
Cold blood runs through my veins
     G
If I soar without grace
           A
Do I still soar
I need the love in your embrace
Open doors, brand new ways
End my wars and erase
And I'm yours
             G
So I want to run to your shelter tonight
Bm
Run to the shelter tonight
United in silent resistance
Of bowing to false kings
So let me run to your shelter tonight
Run from this meaningless pantomime
I'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence

Yes, I wined and, and I dined on, on that cyanide

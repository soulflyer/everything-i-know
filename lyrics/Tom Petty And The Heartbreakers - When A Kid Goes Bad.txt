Am  (D C)
You got a different kind of look in your eye
Something about you that I don't recognize
These things are talked about in quiet tones
I never saw a person so all alone

C Bm Am
Some mama's crying
Some daddy's sad
When a kid goes bad
Make you wonder
What made him mad
Am G F#m F E
When a kid goes bad
When a kid goes bad
Bad
Bad
When a kid goes bad

You're built for innocence, you're built for joy
Suddenly evil's all that you enjoy
But if you shoot at everyone you see
Well, you can't be my friend 'cause you might shoot at me

Some mama's crying
Some daddy's sad
When a kid goes bad
Make you wonder
What made him mad
When a kid goes bad
When a kid goes bad
Bad
Bad
When a kid goes bad

Somewhere along the way, did we let you down?
Did you cry out for help and none was around?
Don't try to tell me that you don't know the score
Are you so shut down, you can't feel anymore?

Some mama's crying
Some daddy's sad
When a kid goes bad
Make you wonder
What made him mad
When a kid goes bad
When a kid goes bad
Bad
Bad
When a kid goes bad

Please accept this life we've prepared for you
All of the ways we've taken care for you
Is this not something that they expected you to do?
How could you not want your destiny handed down to you?

They leave a trail of betrayal and breadcrumbs
As they lie right to our face

In this flood that won't subside
We're swallowed by the tide
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none
As if all you've loved has died
Reach for an empty sky
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none

Reject this life that's prepared for you
All of the ways we've taken care for you
How dare you not do what's been demanded of you?
Sit back, relax, the only way out is through

They leave a trail of betrayal and breadcrumbs
As they lie right to our face
Referendums pending trials and headstones
Broken promises at traitor's gate

In this flood that won't subside
We're swallowed by the tide
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none
As if all you've loved has died
Reach for an empty sky
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none

While you make believe
Let us make all of your dreams come true
For just a small fee
We can provide the perfect life for you

Can we change
Can we rearrange
Plague of insanity
Fate of humanity
No comprehension
No understanding
In all our vanity
Our tragic fallacy
As they lie right to our face

In this flood that won't subside
We're swallowed by the tide
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none
As if all you've loved has died
Reach for an empty sky
The ending has begun
'Til one and one and one are none

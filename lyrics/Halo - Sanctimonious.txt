  God forsaken soul that aches within
  Everything I touch is breaking
  Like hearts fall down
  To tear my insides out
  Give to me your sole posession
  I'll keep it as my own obsession
  Your heart swoops down
  To tear my lifeline out
  So sanctimonious
  I'll take the precipice
  My love can't you see
  I'll be laughing as I face the end
  I believe we're incomplete
  And my heart's retired and obsolete
  And my destiny
  I think she's killing me
  Got to make it out of this
  But I can't obtain a single kiss
  From my destiny
  I guess she's not for me
  So sanctimonious
  I'll take the precipice
  My love can't you see
  I'll be laughing as I face the end
  So sanctimonious
  I'll take the precipice
  My love can't you see
  I'll be laughing as I face the end
  So sanctimonious
  I'll take the precipice
  My love can't you see
  I'll be laughing as I face the end

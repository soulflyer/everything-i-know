Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Spirits in the night, in the night
Spirits in the night, all night
Spirits in the night, in the night
Spirits in the night, all night

How the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davey dancing in the Moonlight
Down near the water in a stoned mud fight
Killer Joe passed out on the lawn
Hazy Davey got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey making love in the dirt
Singing our birthday songs
C             Bm  Am
Janey said it was time to go, so we
D          D        D        D
closed our eyes And said goodbye
D          D       Em    C
                to gypsy angel row
D          D        D        D

Em         C        D        D
Felt       so       right
D          D        D        D
                    together we
D          D        D        D
moved like Spirits in the

night, all night
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
All night, all night
Stand right up and let them shoot through you
Spirits in the night, all night
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
Spirits in the night
Spirits in the night

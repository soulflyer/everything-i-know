"In the space between thought and wonder
Memory cannot pull you under
In the moment between breath and dying
You're free, fearless, you're flying"

It's a new age, gotta make it up as you go
It's all the rage, gotta take it all in tow
You can't be living by the shreds of
What you think you're owed
Sage advice or sensory overload

Whatever the pressure
However your pleasure holds you
Captive to the treasure
No matter how the earth reverberates
You're dancing with the greats
With the fools and their fates
For time it never waits

(Crash the gates) Firedancer, flame of life
(What remains) Is a gamble, fall or fly
(Play your ace) And remember there's a why
You should always question the answer

Are you ready for your life to be laid bare?
And are you sure about the proof by which you swear?
It's all the same, life's a game for name untarnished
By someone else's fear

Whatever they offer
However your wishes beckon
Harder than you reckon
But fire doesn't dance to their dictates
And now you're dancing with the greats
Let the fools have their fates
For time it never waits

(Crash the gates) Firedancer, flame of life
(What remains) Is a gamble, fall or fly
(Play your ace) And remember there's a why
You should always question the answer

At the moment of breath of dying, I am free, fearless, flying
With the Ace

(Crash the gates) Firedancer, flame of life
(What remains) Is a gamble, fall or fly
(Play your ace) And remember there's a why
You should always question the answer

In the brooding silence by the light of the moon
Running through yesterdays gone wrong
Plant a seed of violence it's the same old tune
Lay out the ravages of love

And it cuts so deep that the fool in you is me
But it pays to see the unholy cast of disharmony

Bittersweet revelations, let the mirror come alive
Glorified sensation, your name in the headlines
Oh, revelations, salvation is poison we mystify
It's love with a black eye and no alibi
No illusion to save you this time

You are asylum to my solitude
Playing charades all along
You are a siren where I lay marooned
And here I thought nothing could go wrong

And it cuts so deep that the fool in you is me
But it pays to see the unholy cast of disharmony

Bittersweet revelations, let the mirror come alive
Glorified sensation, your name in the headlines
Oh, revelations, salvation is poison we mystify
It's love with a black eye and no alibi
No illusion to save you this time

Well, this my life story
My fingers to the bone
I'm running after glory
Oh yeah, I should've known
Should have known
Yeah, I should know by now

Bittersweet revelations, let the mirror come alive
Glorified sensation, your name in the headlines
Oh, revelations, salvation is poison we mystify
It's love with a black eye and no alibi
No illusion to save you this time
Ooh ooh

Am F    (Bm G)
Am               F
Words don't come all the time
    C                G            (D A)
The way we feel, the way we slide
    Am           F
The galaxy is so dark and wide
     C             G
Your open arms are mine tonight
      F
And I wait
Am               G
Till the morning after
      F
On my grave
Am             G
Nothing really matters

C           G
Undone in a thousand places
Am          F
Undone from you
C           G
Undone, the ground is breaking
Am              F
Undone, and the mind plays tricks on you
Am G

Truth is I, feel you near
A ghost in black, who disappeared
I put Berlin eyes, in my love A.I.
And mirrors on my ceiling

And I wait
Till the morning after
On my grave
Nothing really matters

Undone in a thousand places
Undone from you
Undone, the ground is breaking
Undone, and the mind plays tricks on you
The mind plays tricks on you

(G F#m D Bb Em D)
F C/F C
Dm/A Dm C

All that I know is the way it feels
All that you say, I've heard it all before

Undone in a thousand places
Undone from you
Undone, the ground is breaking
Undone, and the mind plays tricks on you
Undone, undone
Undone, and the mind plays tricks on you
The mind plays tricks on you

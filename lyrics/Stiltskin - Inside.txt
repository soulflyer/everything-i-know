Swing low In a dark glass hour
You turn and cower
See it turn to dust
Move on a stone dark night
We take to flight
Snowfall turns to rust

Seam in a fusing mine
Like a nursing rhyme
Fat man starts to fall
Here in a hostile place
I hear your face start to call

And if you think
That I've been losing my way
That's because I'm slightly blinded
And if you think
That I don't make too much sense
That's because I'm broken minded

Don't keep it...
Inside
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside

Strong words
In a ganges sky
I have to lie
Shadows move in pairs

Ring out from a bruised postcard
In the shooting yard
Looking through the tears
Out of a black slate time
We move in line
But never reach an end

Fall in a long stray town
As the ice comes down
River starts to bend

And if you think
That I've been losing my way
That's because I'm slightly blinded
And if you think
That I don't make too much sense
That's because I'm broken minded

Don't keep it...
Inside
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside..

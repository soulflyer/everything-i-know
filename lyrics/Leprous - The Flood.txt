Tie me down
If I reach for sunlight
Lift me up
As I scrape the ground

Cut my cord
While you see me climbing
Let me drop
To where I won't be found

Stay with me now when I'm falling
Drown me when I reach for air

Leave me broken
While my spirit shatters
Unchain me
When I drown in shame

Blindfold me
When I search for an answer
Help me see
If I've played your game

Hey you

Hey you
Have you had enough of it
How the blind are leading the blind?
Hey you
Are you angered enough, do you feel confined?
Are you losing your mind?
Hey you
Done putting up with it
Inner peace isn't easy to find
Hey you
Are you strong enough to stop jumping in?
Can we begin again, then?

And when you won't let go
Just keep this thought in mind
The closest mirror reveals the true enemy staring back at you

Hey you, walking away
You've got the wrong kind of mindset
And it's helping no one
Hey you, throw it away
You'll only grow to despise it
Realize it

Hey you

Hey you
Can you feel the effect of it?
That shit keeps rotting your mind
Hey you
Have you woken up, do you still deny, are you gonna comply?
Hey you
This world is full of it
Madness is easy to find
Hey you
Is it bad enough? You continue to lie
Telling me you're fine with it

You know you can't let go
So keep this thought in mind
Your greatest enemy is still alive and growing inside you

Hey you, walking away
You've got the wrong kind of mindset
And it's helping no one
Hey you, throw it away
You'll only grow to despise it
Realize it
Hey you, walking away
You've got the wrong kind of mindset
And it's helping no one
Hey you, throw it away
You'll only grow to despise it
Realize it

(Hey you)

There's too many of us, there's too many of us, there's too many
Too many of us, there's too many of us around
There's too many of us, there's too many of us, there's too many
Too many of us, too many of us now
There's too many of us, there's too many of us, there's too many
Too many of us, there's too many of us around
There's too many of us, there's too many of us, there's too many

Hey you, walking away
You've got the wrong kind of mindset
And it's helping no one
Hey you, throw it away
You'll only grow to despise it
Realize it
Hey you, walking away
You've got the wrong kind of mindset
And it's helping no one
Hey you, throw it away
You'll only grow to despise it
You know you'll grow to despise it
Hey

Hey you, there's too many of us around
Hey you, there's too many of us around
Hey you, there's too many of us around

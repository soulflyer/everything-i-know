a westerner walks into a bar
television on the middle east corner
talks to the barman a bit about cars
a bit about war, and a bit about captain america
’bout 50 thousand dead
what a tragic tale, what a moral dilemma
“what can we do to help?”
say it again and again and again
until you’ve entertained yourself

[verse 1]
said, “hmm, ah, if i’m being honest
never heard of your country until we bombed it”
there’s an invisible gun in my pocket
pays for a round of shots, and a gossip
and a p+ssed+up thought in the water closet
don’t use soap, no tap, don’t wash it, uh
unspoken law of the land
it’s fashionable to have blood on your hands
and you start getting racist
talk about refugees gеtting payslips
fifty a week for needs is outrageous
you spend nearly a ton on a night gеtting wasted

[verse 2]
reform ukkk
“let’s make britain great again”
fingers cl!ck and a monthly wage
is a thousand stellas and a lebanese takeaway
i put my faith in god
and a rich man’s bank account
tv says, “few million displaced”
i say f+cking keep ’em out
[chorus]
when a westerner walks into a bar
television on the middle east corner
talks to the barman a bit about cars
a bit about war, and a bit about captain america
’bout 50 thousand dead
what a tragic tale, what a moral dilemma
“what can we do to help?”
say it again and again and again
until you’ve entertained yourself

[bridge]
i said, “hmm, ah, if i’m being serious
this service is sh+t
and i don’t think you’re hearing this”
the news is depressing
can someone turn it off?
i don’t wanna be dancing
when another bomb drops
another shot, cheap beer
and cheap talk on international relations
state of the war
state of the nation
state of the rich and the poor
state of the— “who gives two sh+ts ’bout some war?”
i’ve been waiting thirty minutes
and i haven’t had another drink yet
is the country in the sink yet?
is the threat of nuclear action on the brink yet?
i will blow your mind when i get the time to think
[verse 4]
says “oh, the horror
i wish i could change it
if i don’t get served in five minutes, i’m complaining”
now i’m getting kicked out
now i’ve got a bottle
i might wrap it up with somebody’s head down the cobbles

[chorus]
when a westerner walks into a bar
television on the middle east corner
talks to the barman a bit about cars
a bit about war, and a bit about captain america
’bout fifty thousand dead
what a tragic tale, what a moral dilemma
“what can we do to help?”
say it again and again and again and again and again and a— ugh

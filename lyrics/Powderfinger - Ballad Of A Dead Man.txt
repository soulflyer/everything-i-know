Original is: Bm E, G A D Bm, G A, D F#m

(Em A C D G Em is about as low as I could comfortably go. High notes are easier, and some open strings work
I think Bm E G A D was working on the baritone, which would mean it was actually F#m or Gm. The later risks
hitting the open b in what should be a Gm chord.)
Better do it in the original key. It's only an f# at the top. I should be able to get that under control.

F#m B
F#m                                          B
Run little rabbit, cant break the habit for none
Shaped like a rocket shoots like a pocket gun
Every mothers son, spent a lifetime on the run
D      E              A
One by one and two by two
    F#m
Our hearts beat a rhythm true
Wave goodbye now baby blue
F#mm                                       D E
You're exploding like a star into the gloom
                  D
I thought I could shut you in
               E
You said 'Baby let me out'
D
I thought that I could pick you up and roll you like a dice, yeah


There's hitchhikers thumbing on the verge of the lovers highway
But we just roll on by with the top down,the sun's out
I'm so glad when you came along you happened to be going my way
The wheels roll round and round

One by one and two by two
Our hearts beat a rhythm true
Wave goodbye now baby blue
You're exploding like a star into the room

I thought I could shut you in
You said "baby pull me out"
I thought that I could pick you up and roll you like a dice to get close to you,
I could feel it coming in,
here they come They're coming one by one
coming two by two
coming one by one
coming two by two

A C#m
E              D
Yeah,if I ever let you down
If anything should come to bleed you dry or cut you out
Dont turn me away

Yeah I never meant to spin you round
If anybody comes to do you harm or pin you down
I'll take your place

If anybody comes to do you harm or pin you down
If any body comes to shut you in or spin you round
I'll take your place
I'll take your place

If anybody comes to shut you in or pin you down
If anybody comes todo you harm or spin you round
Ill take your place

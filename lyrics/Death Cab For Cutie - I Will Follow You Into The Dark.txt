Love of mine Someday
Am
you will die But I'll be
F
close behind, I'll follow
C
you into the
G
dark

No blinding light, Or tunnels to
gates of white, Just our hands
clasped so tight, Waiting for the
hint of a spark

 Am                C
If heaven and hell decide That they
F        C
both are satisfied
Am              C              G
Illuminate the "no′s" on their vacancy signs If
Am             C
there's no one beside you When your
E    Am     G
soul embarks
F                Fm
Then I'll follow you into the
C
dark

In Catholic school, As vicious as
Roman rule, I got my
knuckles bruised, By a
lady in black, And I
held my tongue, As she
told me, "Son, Fear is the
heart of love", So I
never went back

If heaven and hell decide, That they
both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no′s" on their vacancy signs
If there′s no one beside you, When your
soul embarks, Then
I'll follow you into the dark

You and me Have seen every-
thing to see, From Bangkok to
Calgary, And the
soles of your shoes, Are
all worn down, The time for
sleep is now, But it′s nothing to
cry about, 'Cause we′ll
hold each other soon
Am                 F
In the blackest of rooms

And if heaven and hell decide That they
both are satisfied
And illuminate the "no's" on their vacancy signs
If there′s no one beside you, When your
soul embarks, Then
I'll follow you into the dark, Then
I'll follow you into the dark

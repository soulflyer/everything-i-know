Searching for a cause
Leaning on the answers
Nothing comes to mind
When grasping for a thought
Nevermind the cost
Our rival is our modesty
Compromised ideas
Muddy at their core

Freeing yourself from right and wrong
Leaving behind all pride and shame

Follow me, follow us
'Cause there's no one coming to help us
Coming to help us
To defeat this monster
Follow me, follow us
Are we strong enough to betray
Our love and our affection
To defeat this monster

We're better off alone
Nothing left here to discuss
If you bought or if you sold
You still won't get what you want

Freeing yourself from right and wrong
Leaving behind all pride and shame
Closing the door for mental burden
Welcoming back the ones who left

Follow me, follow us
'Cause there's no one coming to help us
Coming to help us
To defeat this monster
Follow me, follow us
Are we strong enough to betray
Our love and our affection
To defeat this monster

'Cause sometimes it is hard to feel hope

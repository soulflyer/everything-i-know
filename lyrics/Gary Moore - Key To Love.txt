I never realised
That you were in pain
Wanna help you honey
Then I'll see you again
That's my soul, baby
When I find I'm feeling love
I'll love you so bad baby
When I find the key to love

Put a smile on your face
And wipe away those tears
Life is gonna get better
As you live through these years
That's my soul, baby
When I find you're feeling rough
Love you so bad, baby
When I find the key to love

Somewhere in this world
The one you waited for
Gonna come along and baby
Turn the key to your door
That's my soul, baby
When I find you're feeling rough
Love you so bad, baby
When I find the key to love

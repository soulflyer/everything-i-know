I've got time to think about

The things you think about when

You've got time to spare

Wonder why we're here

I wonder when or where it might go wrong

I wonder why I went along with you

Why I forgot to think

Forgot to think it through now

I wonder why I

I wonder why

[chorus]

You go on pushing yourself

You keep on fooling yourself

You don't know why, you don't know

You don't know howm you just don't know

You keep on, I keep on fooling myself

There's a time and place for everything

A time to act, a time to dream

There's time to wait

But no time to waste

I wonder why I

I wonder why

[chorus]

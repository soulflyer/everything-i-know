Em C D Bm
Toxins in the earth
Poisons in the air
In the media
Yeah, it's everywhere
No, you were not born
To become a drone
Take the red pill
Down the rabbit hole

They want us distracted
Asleep and absent minded
Wake up and realize
It's all just a lie

Teach the young at school
To obey the rules
They make a profit in slowly killing you
Buy the latest
Stay sedated
Take the red pill
Down the rabbit hole

They want us distracted
Asleep and absent minded
Wake up and realize
It's all just a lie

They want us divided
Fearful and close-minded
Wake up and realize
It's all just a lie

Wake up...

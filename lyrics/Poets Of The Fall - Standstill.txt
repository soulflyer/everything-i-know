Time spent like a spendthrift clown
So many chances wasted
So many hopes let down
You didn't see how your pain
Became your refrain
You always thought there was tomorrow
Wish you could get back what you let go

But it's alright if you fall
You just get up, just go on
Never mind the hurt, even if you burn
Cos it's all, gonna be so much better
The moment your true self's shining through
Like the love when I'm finally holding you

First step after the fall
So many more to take till I'm done with 'em all
With my hopes and my dreams, my anxieties
But there is peace in no expectations
Marveling at the hallucination

Yeah, it's alright if you fall
You just get up, just go on
Never mind the hurt, even if you burn
Cos it's all, gonna be so much better
The moment your true self's shining through
Like the love when I'm finally holding you

Through all these dawns
Oh, winter blues
Still wondering why
And what's the use
Oh, the first hello
To the late goodbye
When I'm made new, yeah

Yeah, it's alright if you fall
You just get up, just go on
Never mind the hurt, even if you burn
Cos it's all, gonna be so much better
The moment your true self's shining through
Like the love when I'm finally holding you

It's alright, yeah, if you fall
You just get up, just go on
Never mind the hurt, even if you burn
Cos it's all, gonna be so much better
The moment your true self's shining through
Like the love when I'm finally holding you

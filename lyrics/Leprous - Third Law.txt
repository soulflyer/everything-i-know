On the rise
Going up
First to be
Alone on the top

No delusion
In your mind
Peripheral vision
Left behind

Somewhere
Someone
Must bow

Despair
Hidden
Somehow

Solid effort
Underground
Undervalue
To be found

Felt inside
Something alive
Devious instinct
To survive

Truly hard
To comprehend
Still effortless
To defend

Real compassion
Obsolete
Camouflaging
Indiscreet

[Verse 1]
Spike the terminal, enhance my visual
I feel the bends coming on
Move between worlds, exist in liminal
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Nitrogen under skin
Expanding in my veins
Clutch my chest, lost my breath
It’s happening again
[Hook]
I see red
Shut me down
There’s no friends in the bends

[Verse 2]
Drop the chemical, kill the sensual
I feel the bends coming on
Processor critical, no longer animal
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Gonna crash, gonna fall
Adrenaline flooding in
Pupils amplify
Leviathan, cryogen
Terror magnified

[Bridge]
I see red
I said that you must shut me down
I see red
I said that you must shut me down
I said, I said
I said that you must shut me down
I said, I said
I said that you must shut mе down
[Hook]
I see red
Shut me down
Therе’s no friends in the bends
There’s no friends in the bends

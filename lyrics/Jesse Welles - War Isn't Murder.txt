War isn't murder
Good men don't die
Children don't starve
And all women survive

War isn't murder
That's what they say
When you're fighting the devil
Murder's okay
Bb Bb/F
War isn't murder
They're called casualties
Bb7
There ain't a veteran
With a good night's sleep

Let's talk about
Ab
dead people
Ab7
I mean a dead people
                    Eb
The dead don't feel honored
                     Cm
They don't feel that brave
                F
They don't feel avenged
                          Bb
They're lucky if they got graves

Call your dead mother
Ask her when she died
It's a deathly silence on the other line
               Ab
The dead don't talk
                         Abm
But their children don't forget
               Eb
So in 20 short years
                  Cm
You could live to regret that

War isn't murder
There's money at stake
Hell, even Kushner agrees
It's good real estate
War isn't murder
Ask Netanyahu
He's got a psalm for that
And a bomb for you
War isn't murder
It's an old desert faith
It's a nation-state sanctioned righteous hate

Let's talk about dead people
I mean a dead people
War isn't murder
It's the vengeance of God
If you can't see the bodies
They don't bloat when they rot
And the flies don't swarm
And the children don't cry
If war isn't murder
Good men don't die

So in a short 20 years
When you vacation the Strip
Don't think about the dead
And have a nice trip

War isn't murder
We should all give thanks
I saw it all in a movie
Give it up for Tom Hanks
War isn't murder
They don't ship out the poor
And the bullets they fire
Aren't part of the cure
War isn't murder
Land is a right
But the banks called dibs
It's something you can't fight

Let's talk about dead people
I mean a dead people
The dead don't feel honor
They don't feel that brave
They don't feel avenged
They're lucky if they got graves

War isn't murder
Ain't a river of blood
Stretching all through time
And raining down in a flood
It's a dark sacrifice
Made on your behalf
So get down on your knees
And thank the sweet lord that
War isn't murder

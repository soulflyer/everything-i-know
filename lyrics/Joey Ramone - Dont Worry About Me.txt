I want you baby, but you always lie

Always complaining or contemplating suicide
I want you baby but you don't even try
Always complaining said a bye baby bye bye bye

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

When I saw you I knew that I wanted ya
But you're the kinda girl that you just can't get through to
Standin' by the corner in a mini skirt
You're the kinda girl that ya just can't forget
Now I'm sittin' here sad and blue
Thinkin' 'bout all that we been through
I gotta get away

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

I want you baby, but you always lie
Always complaining you make the tears fall from my eyes
I want you baby but you don't even try
Always complaining said a bye baby bye bye bye

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Oh, when the lights go out
Abandon reason, listen to them shout
Divine, these monsters of flesh and bone
Oh, they make hate look so easy, no kind

Oh, show me your true ugly
The stranger you move, the sweeter you become
Now show me the good you've done
Show me the animal
We are the animal

Oh, how the times run out
(Everybody down on the ground, now, everybody down, down, down, down)
Burn yourself here in the heat of the sun
Pray it comes undone
Scream your loudest, no one's coming

Oh, show me your true ugly
The stranger you move, the sweeter you become
Now show me the good you've done
Who raised these animals?
(Down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down, down)
(Bang, bang, bang, bang)

Broken migrant, knife through heel
Sing your praise so Hell can hear
Where did you come from?
The strange we walk, the touch we feel
Could you find a way to love us all?
Don't wake up
Show me stolen love
Everything, I need
Take away from me humility
Over and over I fuss, but I can't seem to sleep as they cut
Oh, no, you can't hurt me

Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, can you hear me?
Break, break, breaking up
Break, break, break, follow me
Break, break, breaking up
Can, can, can you hear me?

Oh, show me your true ugly
The stranger you move, the sweeter you become
Now show me the good you've done (The good you've done)
(The good you've done)
Oh, show me your true ugly
The stranger you move, the sweeter you become
Now show me the good you've done
Show me the animal
You fucking animal
Don't feed us the animals
'Cause we're not done with you
There's no good you've done
Oh, show me your true ugly
The stranger you move, the sweeter you become
Now show me the good you've done
Show me the animal

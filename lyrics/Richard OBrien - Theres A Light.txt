In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright
There′s a guiding star
No matter what or who you are


There's a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There′s a light
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light, a light
In the darkness of everybody's life

The darkness must go down the river of night′s dreaming
Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life, into my life

There′s a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There's a light
Burning in the fireplace
There′s a light, a light
In the darkness of everybody's life

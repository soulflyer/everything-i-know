Sleepwalking the Nostromo
Walking in a room down endless corridors
Awaken to a shadow cast across the floor

If I try and run, will I reach the door?

Cannot escape
A cursed vessel echoes with the memories
Machines bleeding energy
On every level, ghosts frozen in time
I′m living like I'm
Sleepwalking the Nostromo
Walking in a room down endless corridors
Awaken to a shadow cast across the floor
If I try and run, will I reach the door?
Cannot escape
It′s not intentional, I'm just another prisoner
We can feel but cannot see each other
It's diabolical and at the same time sublime
I′m living like I′m
Sleepwalking the Nostromo
Walking in a room down endless corridors
Awaken to a shadow cast across the floor
If I try and run, will I reach the door?
Shadows cast across the floor
If I run, will I reach the door?

It's subliminal, a message buried in whispers
Apocalypse for beginners
It′s a ritual, generational rhyme
I'm living like I′m
Sleepwalking the Nostromo
Walking in a room down endless corridors
Awaken to a shadow cast across the floor
If I try and run, will I reach the door?
Cannot escape

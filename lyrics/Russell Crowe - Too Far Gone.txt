     C                     G
I am drowning, not waving, Here in the darkness,
F            G
I'll find my peace,
C                      G
You'll try to save me, but you are suspended,
F                               G
Beneath the surface in way too deep,

         Am      G          C
And your fingers tear at my skin,
F                          G
Release the blood let the feeding begin,
Am              G             C
Your intentions will never be blamed,
F                  G          C
We're both too far gone, to be saved,

     C                  G
When times were simple, the journey clearer,
Before the circles and deja vu,
Before all the bombs fell, and we lived in craters,
Before the sharks came and had their fill,
Your fingers tear at my skin,
Release the blood let the feeding begin,
Your intentions will never be blamed,
We're both too far gone, to be saved,
We're both too far gone, to be saved,

I could have spared you and you might have warned me
    F                         G
The glory is fleeting for the birds in flight,
Am                        Em
Now I am sinking weighed down by regrets,
F                G
I see clearly in this dying light I am

drowning not waving,
G    
Will you just love me,
F            G
It's not too late,
Here in the darkness, no one can judge us,
Kiss me completely and seal our fate,
Your fingers tear at my skin,
Release the blood let the feeding begin,
Your intentions will never be blamed,
We're both too far gone, to be saved,

We're both too far gone, to be saved,
We're both too far gone, to be saved.

Fire is what unites us
Fire's from whence we came
Guess I was wrong to cloud us
And cover that hidden flame

If I was free to have you
If my hands were not tied
If my gaze was unbroken
And my pleas not denied

In the approaching twilight
Your love's a hidden hand
But if I ever lose you
There's no one left to stand
Between me
The nothingness and the devil

Fire is the awakening
Once the trauma's been obscured
The way the light gets heavy
Is a sign of what we endured

Fever is the horizon
Beyond the break of dawn
We'll find the answers
When all hope is gone

In the approaching twilight
Your love's a hidden hand
But if I ever lose you
There's no one left to stand
Between me
The nothingness and the devil

In the approaching twilight
Your love's a hidden hand
But if I ever lose you
There's no one left to stand
Between me
The nothingness and the devil

Am
The grieving widow's pose, she stands with head held high,
C
Never to re-marry, never gonna try
F
'Cause that would end the symphony of sadness that we play,
E
And end the songs of wonder lost that she commiserates,
So she takes another shot of Crown, it helps to ease the pain,
In hopes to ease the void inside, yet somehow it's in vain,
'Cause vanity has come along and filled her perfume vial,
And every day she dabs a little on her neck and smiles,

F G      Am
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
F         G            Am
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside,
F         G            E
Open your eyes, let us see

The old man sits alone, staring at the screen,
And contemplates his failures, done to his family,
'Cause depression's bottles come along and filled his whiskey glass,
With every sip put to his lips erases all the past,
So he tells another little lie and tells another tale,
In hopes to spare the family and hide his private hell,
But the more the words come out of him like little cuts and scabs,
Tearing at the tender hearts who gaze upon a mask,

Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside

She puts her feet in well-worn shoes
Walks toward the past
Of the character
Behind the mask

C      G                 Am
Slowly climb out of your shell
G
Start to believe
C     G                  Am
Every now and then those demons
     G
Will come to feast
Am G    F     G   Em
On your flesh and bones

Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside
Open your eyes, let us see

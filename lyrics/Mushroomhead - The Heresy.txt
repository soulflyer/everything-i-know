We feed the war machine
The sacrifice has just begun
We feed the war machine

Hide your daughters, your first born sons
As we welcome all your catastrophe
All the hate, all the lies and the heresy
How divine that every time you hide in denial
Suicidal kings

You are my poison
Poseidon inside me
Pontius is present
And God is beside me
The tide tends to wave
In a foul disposition

Hide your daughters, your first born sons
As we welcome all your catastrophe
All the hate, all the lies and the heresy
How divine that every time you hide in denial
Suicidal kings

We feed the war machine
Suicidal kings
We feed the war machine
Suicidal

Foster the future and nurture the land
Stitches and sutures, divisions in sand
Mass evacuations, sanctions for land
It's time we stand for something
Walking hand in hand

Foster the future and nurture the land
Stitches and sutures, divisions in sand
Mass evacuations, sanctions for land
It's time we stand for something
Walking hand in hand

We feed the war machine
The sacrifice has just begun
We feed the war machine

Hide your daughters, your first born sons
As we welcome all your catastrophe
All the hate, all the lies and the heresy
How divine (We feed the war machine)
Every time you hide in denial (We feed the war machine)
Suicidal kings

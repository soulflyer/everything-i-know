Use your head, break away from this
Don't trust in a scale unfairly levelled
Ask yourself, do I need to stay
Or am I restrained by my possessions
Wake us up, free us from our fate
Give us something real to fight for
Break us out from reality
Rescue us from domination

Take the lead to guide the course
Break the chains enslaving us

We are one, undivided fallen sons
And we are designed to open our hearts to the night
Not to serve and comply
We have a fire burning inside of us all
Driving us to break out

Take the fall, blame it on yourself
Gather what you've lost and start from zero
Wander on, sacred is your time
Don't resign the things you care for
No remorse, no passivity
Driven by determination

Take control of your innocence
It is easy to walk the distance and fade away
Away we go to the unknown
To lessen the pain
So far within, it breaks the skin
And clears the trail

Be aware of your ignorance
There's a reason why the deceitful do find a prey
Among the lost we share the cost
And feed off the pain
The time is in, thicken your skin
And give it a chance

We are one, undivided fallen sons
And we are designed to open our hearts to the night
Not to serve and comply
We have a fire burning inside of us all
Driving us to break out
We are the designed to fight for what burns in our hearts
To unleash who we are
'Cause there is a fire burning inside of us all
Tearing down every wall

I come down the steps
I slip on the ice
Santa Claus been lookin'
Who's been naughty, who's been nice

I'm lookin' for one thing real tonight

And Jesus, he comes up to me
Jesus, he sits down
He says, "Take this fuckin' cross off my back
I'm goin' downtown."

I say, "Aw, but ain't that your uniform?"
He offers me a toke
Says 2000 years is long enough
For this particular joke

He says, "I'm lookin' for one thing real tonight."

And I'm up here singin'
These songs every night
Sometimes I wanna just make 'em all
Up on the spot

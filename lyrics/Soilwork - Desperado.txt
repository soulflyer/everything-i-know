"Why don't you,
Come to your senses? The oracle said
You gave up the living to speak with the dead
I witnessed your rising, I saw your demise
But nothing could quench all that need in your eyes

I've been hiding inside a mist of sorrows
Silently hoping for you to pierce the veil

And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
And your gods will see us
Once you find your way inside
And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
But you'd rather lose it all
Than leave this fire denied
Desperado

Why don't you,
Come to your senses, degenerate one?
Our only creation is coming undone
Like desperate measures for desperate times
These symbols of chaos already aligned

I've been hiding inside a mist of sorrows
Silently hoping for you to pierce the veil

And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
And your gods will see us
Once you find your way inside
And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
But you'd rather lose it all
Than leave this fire denied
Desperado

And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
(Once you find your way inside)
And your gods will see us
Once you find your way inside
(Once you find your way inside)
And the walls between us
Are what kept us both alive
But you'd rather lose it all
Than leave this fire denied
Desperado

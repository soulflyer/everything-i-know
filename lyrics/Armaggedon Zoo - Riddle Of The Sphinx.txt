Who's idea of liberty
I've signed no contract to society
Whats done is already done, but
Throw away your bible and your gun
It's a violation of the constitution
A reincarnation of an institution
Who's, freedom to choose
Mine, well I must be blind
Cos its not a bit like every body thinks
An easy answer to the riddle of the sphinx
You can kid me that I'll be missed
But don't kid me I don't exist

Time after time (time after time)
Day after day (day after day)
Way after way
They make me pay

A pat on the back for a first offender
Law and order, the great pretender
take a look in a history book
it doesn't have to be a mystery
look it's happening now and you just let it
you sit there so appathetic
I want to walk out on the pavement
I don't want to talk it out with the government
Three cheers for the welfare state
Who give it to me on a silver plate
10 out of 10 for a perfect doctrine
10 out of 10 if you throw it in the dustbin

Time after time (time after time)
Day after day (day after day)
Way after way
They make me pay

solo

Time after time (time after time)
Day after day (day after day)
Way after way
They make me pay

Time after time (time after time)
Day after day (day after day)
Way after way
They make me pay

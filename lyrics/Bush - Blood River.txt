I wear your mind like a sweater, all mine
Caring less saves so much time
Floating like a pinball wizard
I play to win but there's all these sinners
Defrocked priests on bended knees
We are the vines of the strongest trees

All of us with a thousand injuries
You're not alone when you're with me

Down Jacob's Ladder to the Devil's stage
On Blood River, I burn your name
Swear my intentions with rings of gold
On Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go

I've wasted twelve days straight
I'm a bull out of the gate
Surround your enemy with ways of escape
Harder to love, easy to hate
Don't be afraid, don't be the problem
Guilt and fear, the death of solution
What do you see? What's your pollution?

All of us with a thousand injuries
You're not alone when you're with me

Down Jacob's Ladder to the Devil's stage
On Blood River, I burn your name
Swear my intentions with rings of gold
On Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go

Defrocked priests on bended knees
We are the vines of the strongest trees

All of us with a thousand injuries
You're not alone when you're with me

Down Jacob's Ladder to the Devil's stage
On Blood River, I burn your name
Swear my intentions with rings of gold
On Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go

Blood River, let it all go
Blood River, let it all go

- Are you real, I mean I'm not imagining you am I?
-- we're real enough
- You speak English, Earth People?
-- From the Federation

Would you believe in people smiling starships on the ground
Would you believe all understanding coming from the sound
Would you believe in people turning away from the dreary past
And looking towards a future shining of a love that will last

Would you believe
Would you believe
There is no use to pretend the circle is coming to an end
Soon as you believe
Soon as you believe

Would you believe a heart that's crying for your very soul
Would you believe I care about you, more than you know

Would you believe I care about you, more than you know

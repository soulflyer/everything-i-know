It was seven forty seven
We were on our way to heaven
In a race car to the stars
With a city of blazing lights embracing us
We never thought to worry, 'cause we
Only thought of glory
And we trusted our lucky stars
So we never thought mere
Seconds would betray us

Thought we saw true
In the bright youth
Ghost of light come shining through
In the dawn blue, in a breath they flew

Silent now the sounds of yesterday
I'm treading on sacred ground again
Like a single errant ray
Showing us the wounds we both sustained
And our sacred pain
Till silent fall the sounds of yesterday

Nothing I do, nothing I say will ever turn the rising tide
In the vein of fever dreams
It seems to ride us
We never said we're sorry and the pattern wrote the story
One more death by friendly fire
All on pain of missing out on that final rush

Did we run through before we knew what it was we left behind?
Hunting ghostlights all the white nights through

Silent now the sounds of yesterday
I'm treading on sacred ground again
Like a single errant ray
Showing us the wounds we both sustained
And our sacred pain
Till silent fall the sounds of yesterday

Hear them softly sigh
The sounds of yesterday
Let them heal our wounds
If I close my eyes, I can see you
Oh I can see you close enough to touch
I hardly dare to dream you, oh, lest it be too much
What's the moral of the story when I
Only see us fighting, elegy to
To the starry-eyed
Ooh

Silent now the sounds of yesterday
I'm treading on sacred ground again
Like a single errant ray
Showing us the wounds we both sustained
And our sacred pain
Till silent fall the sounds of yesterday

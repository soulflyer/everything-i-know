Maybe we're all dreamers
I don't know where to go
Somewhere deep in the ocean (Ocean)
Where the wild fires glow

Lately got burned diving (Diving, diving)
I found a place where I can love my black heart
I used to think that you could fix me
I used to think 'til death us do part

Are we not slaves?
Ghosts in the machine
Happiness in waves
So clean and serene
Are we not slaves?
Slaves
Are we not? (Are we not, are we not)

Give me the antidote (Antidote)
'Cause I really want to stay alive
I get my feeling that you're sinking (Sinking)
I'd like to pull you out in time, in time

Are we not slaves?
Ghosts in the machine
Happiness in waves
So clean and serene
Are we not slaves?
Slaves
Slaves
Are we not?

So many people inside of you
So many people inside of you
Where the wind blows, where the wind blows, where the wind blows
Where the wind blows

I give you the best of me
Forty five, fifty five
I give you the best of me
Forty five, fifty five

Are we not slaves?
Slaves
Ghosts in the machine
Happiness in waves
So clean and serene
Are we not slaves?
I wanted to be saved
Are we not slaves?
Slaves
Are we not?

I give you the best of me
Forty five, fifty five
Forty five, fifty five

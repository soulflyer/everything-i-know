[Janet]
In the velvet darkness of the blackest night
Burning bright, there's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are

[Brad & Janet]
There's a light

[Phantoms]
Over at the Frankenstein place

[Brad & Janet]
There's a light

[Phantoms]
Burning in the fireplace

[Brad & Janet]
There's a light, light
In the darkness of everybody's life

[Riff Raff]
The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming
Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life
Into my life

[Brad & Janet]
There's a light

[Phantoms]
Over at the Frankenstein place

[Brad & Janet]
There's a light

[Phantoms]
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light, a light

[Brad & Janet]
In the darkness of everybody's life

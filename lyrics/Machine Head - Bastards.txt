Yesterday I told my sons "sometimes the bad guys win"
G
And that it made me scared about the world that we live in
Am
But I had to reassure them that it wouldn't be for long
F
Sons we have to be ourselves, we have to be strong

I said "boys you are the future, so let this be a lesson
There may come a day you have to fight off their aggression"
Cause fear and hatred won today, the darkness ate the light
But both you look in my eyes, it'll be alright

In every step you take
I'm with you all the way
Cause I would die for you, To do what's right for you
In hopes that when I'm gone You'll carry on these words I wrote for you
G
Till then…
F
I'll sing

Stand your ground
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don't let their fears make you afraid
There's hope, they'll change

Well I looked out to the world today, thought "what a bloody mess!"
They stripped our morals from us, put 'em under house arrest
And "liberty" and "country" are the words they need to speak
A little "god", a little "freedom", if we don't agree, we're weak

And every politician stood there idle and so smug
Empowering the racists and 2nd Amendment thugs
Wall St. and the billionaires, convinced us they're so smart
Saying "vote with your wallet, instead of with your hearts!"

But we won't go away!
We won't forget our name!
The pussy generation, the PC and the brave
The protesters that slink along the streets of misery

And so…
I'll sing

Stand your ground
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don't let their fears make you afraid
There's hope, they'll change
We'll change
Change

No, no, no, no, no (FUCK NO!)
No, no, no, no, no (FUCK NO!)
No, no, no, no, no (FUCK NO!)

So give us all your faggots, and your niggas, and your spics
Give us all your Muslims, your so-called terrorists
We'll welcome them with open arms, and put 'em in our mix
We're better off together now, embrace our difference

Remember there is love
Our words can stop their guns
Forget the rednecks living in the past
We're never going back now, we've reached critical mass

And so…
I'll sing

Stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
I'm bold, I'm strange
Won't let their fears make me afraid
There's hope, they'll change

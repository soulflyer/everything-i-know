D             Bb       Gm  C
Angels on the sideline
D             Bb  Gm C
Puzzled and amused,  Why did Father
give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused
D                   Bb                Gm       C
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go
D        Bb Gm F
around?
D               Bb          Gm             C
Sitting in this holy garden, silly monkeys where there's one you're
bound to divide it
D            D D C
Right in two


D Bb Gm C
Angels on the sideline,
Baffled and confused, Father
blessed them all with reason, And
this is what they choose?

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the
ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they forge a blade, and where there's one they're
bound to divide it right in
two, right in
two

Monkey killing, monkey killing monkey over pieces of the
ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club to beat their brother
down
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
D                 Bb               F               G
To lift an eye to heaven conscious of our fleeting time here

D               Bb           G    G
Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two
Gotta divide it all right in two

Need for power, greed for land
No one'll ever make me understand
There's no way it can be justified,
Why people have to fight and die

Do you understand what I'm trying to say,
There has to be a better way.

I'm not saying you should stop the fight,
Or disbelieve what you believe to be right
You might have to make a sacrifice,
But it shouldn't be human life.

Do you understand what I'm trying to say,
There has to be a better way.

How many times do I have to say,
How many lives were lost today,
Peace is shot before my eyes
Hidden behind a flash disguise.

At the end of the first world war,
People said they don't want no more,
Everybody thought that it was true,
And then they stepped right into world war 2

Do you understand what I'm trying to say,
There has to be a better way.

How many times do I have to say,
How many lives were lost today,
Peace is shot before my eyes
Hidden behind a flash disguise.

On a future of peace they have locked the door,
All they seem to want is war,
We've got to shout or we won't be heard,
Before much longer it'll be the third

How many, how many, how many times do I have to say,
How many, how many, how many lives were lost today,
How many, how many, how many argh

This is the point
Of no return
I gather pace and you're my primary concern
Too late to hide
Too late to run
This is the end
And it has only just begun

Relief from hurt and fears
Depart from your vale of tears

Louder than hell
Louder than faith
Louder than lies
We're invincible tonight
Faster than fire
Harder than steel
Brighter than stars
Free and featherlight we are

This is your time
So get your gist
Too many things pending on your bucket list
You'll be the one
Who's cheating hell
Uncatchable
You'll be the whitecap on the swell

Relief from hurt and fears
Depart from your vale of tears

Louder than hell
Louder than faith
Louder than lies
We're invincible tonight
Faster than fire
Harder than steel
Brighter than stars
Free and featherlight we are
...

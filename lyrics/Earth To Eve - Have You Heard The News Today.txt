Have you heard the news today?
D
Bombs have dropped, the swamp is drained
C#m
America is finally getting saved!
11 millions off of Medicaid
Temperatures rise like interest rates
Built Auschwitz, in the Everglades and sold merch at the front gate
They’re starving, sick and sleep deprived
But they don’t look like you or I
Guess empathy don’t cross state lines in the great US of A
They flags got no more blue or white
They, sold the stars we all wear stripes
No need to read between the lines when there’s blood spilled on the page
Never again means not today

C#m                       A
You gave the man your eyes so you could sleep at, night
E                        B
But you still hear their cries you can’t outrun this, shame
This land was yours and , mine ‘til they bled it, dry
history won’t be kind to those who turned the other way
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Can you hear them crying?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I still hear them crying
And I can hear your silence
E D C#m A
Mmm

Empathy becomes partisan when rights get framed as politics
And born again, republicans start ditchin’ what their scripture said
Oh, hate thy neighbor? Turn ‘em in
And burn amendments 5 and 10
The faithful, bent the cross to fit but heavy is the crown that sits on top
His empty head will only pledge allegiance to self, interest
to help the rich get rich, at your expense while you absolve his sins
And your indifference ain’t righteousness it’s, evil at its best
Celebrate ignorance and share and clap as the boot steps on your neck,, til it snaps

You gave the man your, eyes so you could sleep at, night
But you still hear their cries, you can’t outrun this, shame
This land was yours and, mine ‘til they bled it, dry
history won’t be kind to those who turn the other way
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Can you hear them crying?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I still hear them crying
Ohh ohh ohuh, uh
Ah ah ah
Can you hear them crying?
Oh oh-u-uh, uh, u-uh
Oh uh uh
I still hear them crying
Will you still stay silent?

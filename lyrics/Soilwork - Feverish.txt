Feverish like the joining of hands
In a futile attempt to draw lines in the sand
Feverish like the merging of limbs
So that one body burns where the other begins
Feverish like a gothic affair
Where you long for the dark but it's already there
Feverish, the mechanics of life
All the means to ascend that you gave me tonight

And there were times when I got closer
But as soon as the light departs
All this needless longing
Shatters me as we drift apart
Let it go

If there's a way that I could reach you
Feverish like this
'Cause now I've found the final part
That's missing
If there's a place where I can feel you
Feverish like this
Where our beings will be reunited

Feverish like this
Feverish like this
Feverish like this
Feverish like this

Feverish like the coming of death
The inevitable urge that I felt on your breath
Feverish, the mechanics of life
All the means to ascend that you gave me tonight

And there were times when I got closer
But as soon the light departs
All this needless longing
Shatters me as we drift apart
Let it go

If there's a way that I could reach you
Feverish like this
'Cause now I've found the final part
That's missing
If there's a place where I can feel you
Feverish like this
Where our beings will be reunited

Feverish like this
Feverish like this
Feverish like this
Feverish like this

Let it go

If there's a way that I could reach you
Feverish like this
'Cause now I've found the final part
That's missing
If there's a place where I can feel you
Feverish like this
Where our beings will be reunited

I always flirt with death
C#m             A
I look ill, but I don′t care about it
I can face your threats and stand up straight
And tall and shout about it

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I′m on another planet with you
With you

You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no

I think I′m on another world with you
With you
I′m on another planet with you
With you

Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet

Space travel's in my blood
There ain′t nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out
But I know I can't live without it, I know

I think I′m on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you

Another girl who′s loving you now
Another planet who's holding you down
Another planet

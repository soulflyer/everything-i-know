Oh, dear Rumi
My little baby I love you
You move me, my son
You improve me
Cause you're the one

The wisdom of the word, the source of all of creation
Ecstasy of devotion and the sound of every action
Striving to hear and see all life an anomaly
Never lose that wonder, the necessity of mystery

Be drunk with passion and the peaceful rivers of love
Close both your eyes and hear the distant flight of doves

When you're grown up in your prime
Stay away from God and crime
Embody justice for this tormenting, tormented world
You will learn something every day
Don't dip your toes, go all the way
Be the change you want to see and be the man you want to be

Oh dear Rumi, the supreme poet of love
You move me like the sun
Become the truth and hold it above all
Get lost in the breeze of the trees that stand tall

Don't you realize that it's all about knowledge and love
Close both your eyes and hear the distant flight of doves

When you're grown up in your prime
Stay away from God and crime
Embody justice for this tormenting, tormented world
You will learn something every day
Don't dip your toes, go all the way
Be the change you want to see and be the man you want to be

Man you want to be...

Dear son, I pray that your days are long
And your path matches your song
Your smile is worth every sacrifice in this life
Your breath now my reason to go on
I love you more than I ever could imagine
For any being on this earth

When you're grown up in your prime
Stay away from God and crime
Embody justice for this tormenting, tormented world
You will learn something every day
Don't dip your toes, go all the way

When you're grown up in your prime
Stay away from God and crime
Embody justice for this tormenting, tormented world
You will learn something every day
Don't dip your toes, go all the way
Be the change you want to see and be the man you want to be

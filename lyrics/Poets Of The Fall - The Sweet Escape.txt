Lying in the arms of night
In the shadows of the firelight
Suspended by this feeling of fading away

I wanna run away with you
So meet me by the cut through
Together we'll make our sweet escape

'Cause you're fearless in your love
Devoted to compassion
The highest state of art
Piercing in your truth
Sincere in all intention
The way you wear your heart
The way you hold my heart
My fierce friend

Under a canopy of stars
Where thought and truth divorce
In that latticework of dreams we are shameless

I wanna run away with you
Somewhere they cannot undo
Together we'll make our sweet escape

'Cause you're fearless in your love
Devoted to compassion
The highest state of art
Piercing in your truth
Sincere in all intention
The way you wear your heart
The way you hold my heart

And this is why I love you
Why you're the only one
You're the only one
Who has seen me come undone
And then seen beyond

'Cause you're fearless in your love
Devoted to compassion
The highest state of art
And you're piercing in your truth
Sincere in all intention
The way you wear your heart
The way you hold my heart
The way you hold my heart
The way you hold my heart
The way you hold my heart
The way you hold my heart
My fierce friend

I wanna run away tonight
Just leave everything behind
Together we'll make our sweet escape

In the shadows out of sight
Like ghosts in ultraviolet

I had to tell ya, it's now or never
So much for closure, I lost composure
I get the message, I learned my lesson
Tried to correct it, I think I wrecked it
Man, it's a crisis, I'm never like this
That's how my life is, you couldn't write this

I'm a loser, babe
Do you wanna tear my heart out?
I'm a tragedy
Tryin' to figure this whole mess out

I'm out of favor, my worst behavior
I get the message, I learned my lesson
Desperate times call for desperate measures
I fell into ya, I fell into ya
Tried to correct it, well shit, I wrecked it

I'm a loser, babe
Do you wanna tear my heart out?
I'm a tragedy
Tryin' to figure my whole life out

I leave alone and
Dark streets I roam in
Night air, I breathe in
The stars I believe in

I don't know why I didn't fight it
I probably tried and magnified it
I cannot lie, I feel defeated
Take it as a sign, you're badly needed
You're badly needed
Badly wanted
Fuck

G D Am Em

I won't take all that they hand me down
And make out a smile, though I wear a frown
'Cause I'm not gonna take it all lying down
'Cause once I get started, I go to town
       Em                     D
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
C                      Em
I'm not like everybody else
Em                     D
I'm not like everybody else
C                      C
I'm not like everybody else

Em                                  D         Am
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I don't want to be destroyed like everybody else
And I don't want to get a job like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

But darling, you know that I love you true
Do anything that you want me to
Confess all my sins like you want me to
;;There's one thing that I will say to you
There's one thing that I can't do for you, cos

I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

;;And I don't want to walk about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I don't want to be destroyed like everybody else
And I don't want to get a job like everybody else
;;And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else

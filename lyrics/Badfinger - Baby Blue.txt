Guess I got what I deserved
A        E                 B4    B
Kept you waiting there too long, my love
F#                      E
All that time without a word
A      E                     E   B
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget or
F#
I'd regret

The special love I had for you, my baby blue

All the days became so long
Did you really think, I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know
I would show the special love I have for you, my baby blue

D#m G#m        G#m/G      C#m C#m/B
What can I do, what can I say
A
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you, show me the way
Don't you know the times I've tried?

Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger every day
Just one thing before I go
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow
The special love you have for me, my Dixie, dear.

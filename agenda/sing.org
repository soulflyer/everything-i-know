perhaps worth trying, not necessarily with a view to performing them.
** The Flood: Leprous
Sequence it, focus on the singing
** Third Law: Leprous
Maybe not. Great song though.
** Take the Power Back: Rage Against The Machine
Might be fun to learn. Note sure about actually performing it.
** Hurt: Johnny Cash
** Smoke and mirrors: Echoes of Eternity
- Em C D Bm
Might be fun to learn the riffs. Especially the solo which is riffs rather than widdle. May be good exercises. "Take the red pill, down the rabbit hole."
** Schism: Tool
Learn this for the excellent timing. From wikipedia:
"Schism" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times.[8] The song begins with two bars of 5/4, followed by one bar of 4/4, followed by bars of alternating 5/8 and 7/8, until the first interlude, which consists of alternating bars of 6/8 and 7/8.

The following verse exhibits a similar pattern to the first, alternating bars of 5/8 and 7/8. The next section is four bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. This takes the song back into alternating 5/8 and 7/8. Another 6/8 and 7/8 section follows, and after this the song goes into repeating bars of 5/8 and 9/8. The section ends with the music hanging suspended over a bar of 9/8.

The middle section is subsequently introduced at 3:29, maintaining a group of three bars of 6/8 then one of 9/8 until 5:02. Then a series of 8/4, 10/4, 8/4, 8/4, then 9/8 heading into "Between supposed lovers..." which is a three bar group of 9/8, 10/8 and 9/8, played twice.

It breaks down with a measure of 13/8 then 9/8. 5/8 then 9/8 repeats 3 times then 5/8 and 6/8 once. The signature riff takes over again, 5/8 then 7/8. The final riff is 8/8.

The band has referred to the time signature as 6.5⁄8.
** The Nurturing Glance: Soilwork
Might be possible. Hmm...
* Cooperations
** Happy: Pharrell Williams

** Smoke on the water: Deep Purple
** Sunshine of your love: Cream
** Every Breath You Take: Police

#+TITLE: attempting to build X11 emacs
# TAGS #emacs #X11

make failed, this fixed it:

rm lisp/loaddefs.el; make

brew doesn't support X11 any more, these might help:

Finally got the X11 version to build with this configure command:
(master) build: ../configure --with-xpm=ifavailable --without-ns --with-x --with-x-toolkit='lucid' --with-xft="$WITH_XFT" --without-makeinfo --with-gif='no' --enable-symbols PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/'

Had to ad the with-xpm option, not sure if that is causing a problem. emacs runs but locks up when I try to start exwm with message:
error in process filter: [XELB]Connection failed: No protocol specified

Also Meta key isn't working

  wine has the following notes:
    When using the Mac Driver, it might be useful to enable RetinaMode when
    you're using a high DPI monitor. To do that, open up Wine's Registry
    Editor:

      wine regedit

    and then navigate to:

      [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Mac Driver]

    and then set "RetinaMode" to "y". You may also want to adjust your DPI
    under the Graphics tab in winecfg.

#+TITLE: ionic ion-nav-title
# TAGS #ionic

<ion-view view-title="{{whatever}}">

the title doesn't appear until after a refresh

<ion-view>
  <ion-nav-title>{{whatever}}</ion-nav-title>
  
fixes this.

resolve in the .state was also suggested, but may cause excessive delays because it makes the page being rendered wait for {{whatever}} to complete. 

afterEnter in the .controller was also suggested

#+TITLE: lsp not showing documentation
# Tags #clojure #lsp
Turns out this was because I had opened the clj file before I created the project.clj so lsp was treating the src directory as a project and not finding the requires to link to the included stuff.
Fixed it by doing:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(lsp-workspace-folders-remove)
#+end_src

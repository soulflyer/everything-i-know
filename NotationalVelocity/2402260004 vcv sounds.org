* VCOs
** *Oscillators* from *Mus-X*

[[file:2402260004 vcv sounds-images/oscillators.png]]
Using *Tune* to adjust the pitch of oscillator 2 for *sync* effects. This *VCO* has the ability to set the oversampling rate. With it turned down it is possible to hear and see the effects of [[https://github.com/kockie69/SquinkyVCV-main/blob/master/docs/aliasing.md][Aliasing]]
Note: Osc-1 is not turned turned down in this screen shot, which is ok although it may be obscurring the effects of the sync which are only heard on osc-2.

** *Palette* from *Atelier*

[[file:2402260004 vcv sounds-images/Atelier.png]]

Does lots of weird stuff, changing the interface to match the synthesis method in use. The screenshot has it set on the most conventional. Quite useful as it has a built in *AD* envelope that can control all sorts of things.
[[https://github.com/Xenakios/Atelier][github]] has a little info in the readme.

** *String VCO* from *Surge*

[[file:2402260004 vcv sounds-images/string.png]]
Gives a nice plucked string sound.

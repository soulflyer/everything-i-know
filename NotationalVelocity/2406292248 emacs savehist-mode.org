#+TITLE: emacs savehist-mode
# Tags #emacs
Savehist was not working because I was doing this:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq savehist-mode t)
#+end_src
ie setting the variable rather than calling the function :-/

From *savehist.el*

;; To use savehist, turn on savehist-mode by putting the following in
;; `~/.emacs':
;;
;;     (savehist-mode 1)
;;
;; or with customize: `M-x customize-option RET savehist-mode RET'.
;;
;; You can also explicitly save history with `M-x savehist-save' and
;; load it by loading the `savehist-file' with `M-x load-file'.

** Lecture 1A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA Introduction to lisp - Harold Abelson
Includes description of a method to find square roots which could be a good example to play with when exploring functions


** Lecture 1B
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_7mmwpgJHU Proceedures and processes - Gerald J Sussman
Difference between a proceedure and a process. Includes an implementation of + that would make a good demo to help understand the way lisps work
Also has a good very basic intro to O notation and implementation of recurrsion. Including some clues about tail calls.

*** Implementing +
Can be done by taking one item off the second pile and putting it on the first until there are none left to take.
#+begin_src lisp
  (define (+ x y)
      (if (= x 0)
          y
          (+ (-1+ x) (1+ y))))
#+end_src

Demonstrate the process generated by the procedure like this:
#+begin_src lisp
(+ 3 4)
(+ 2 5)
(+ 1 6)
(+ 0 7)
7
#+end_src

Another subtly different method. This one can be thought of as taking one at a time off the first pile and holding on to them until the pile is empty, then putting them back onto the second pile.
#+begin_src lisp
  (define (+ x y)
      (if (= x 0)
          y
          (1+ (+ (-1+ x) y))))
#+end_src

Demonstrate the process generated by the procedure like this:
#+begin_src lisp
(+ 3 4)
(1+ (+ 2 4))
(1+ (1+ (+ 1 4)))
(1+ (1+ (1+ (+ 0 4))))
(1+ (1+ (1+ 4)))
(1+ (1+ 5))
(1+ 6)
7
#+end_src

Notice the second grows and compare to not being able to keep too many things in your hand at one time

2 methods, both definitions are *recursive* but the process created by the first one is iterative and the process generated by the second is recursive.

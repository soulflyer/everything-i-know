#+TITLE: emacsclient open with
# TAGS #emacs #emacsclient

Trying to use open-with in the finder and emacsclient isn't available.

Use an applescript saved as an application..

Add stuff to the applets info .plist file

Bundle identifier       diw.emacsclient

and maybe the file types it understands? (Steal them from textedits info.plist)

Tell launchservices about the changes:
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchSe
rvices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain sy
stem -domain user

Script for use in *Automator* The -n option causes emacsclient to return immediately. If it isn't there then it is necessary to close one file opened this way using *C-x #* before another can be opened.
#+begin_src bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/emacsclient -n "$1"
#+end_src

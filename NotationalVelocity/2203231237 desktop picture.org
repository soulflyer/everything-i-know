#+TITLE: desktop picture
# Tags #osx

Setting the desktop picture doesn't stick when using an external monitor. Replacing the default picture it reverts to with something less hideous may not be an option:

Would need to reboot in recovery mode to edit the files, then the OS will no longer trust the filesystem and then Filevault can't be used (do I care?)

Script to set the desktop picture might be enough, if I can get it to work with multiple spaces.
#+begin_src shell
osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to tell every desktop to set picture to \"${1}\" as POSIX file"
#+end_src
Doesn't seem to do it for all spaces, just the current one. Now got it bound to ctrl-cmd-x in skhdrc so I can quickly fix it per desktop.
#+begin_src
# ctrl + cmd - x : /Users/iain/bin/desktop /Users/iain/Pictures/59470036.jpg 2>&1 > /tmp/error.log
#+end_src

j doesn't work after doing a port install autojump. Seems the shell functions need to be installed.

from the install shell script:
echo "You need to run 'source ${rc_file}' before you can start using autojump. To remove autojump, run './uninstall.sh'"

source /opt/local/etc/profile.d/autojump.bash

seemed to do the trick

Now using zoxide instead of autojump (2021)

#+TITLE: clojure add hook to a function
# TAGS #clojure

https://github.com/technomancy/robert-hooke

Robert Hooke provides a flexible, composable mechanism by which you can extend behaviour of functions after they've been defined.

#+begin_src clojure
(defn examine [x]
  (println x))

(defn microscope
  "The keen powers of observation enabled by Robert Hooke allow
  for a closer look at any object!"
  [f x]
  (f (.toUpperCase x)))

(examine "something")
> something

(with-scope
  (add-hook #'examine #'microscope)
  (examine "something"))
> SOMETHING

(examine "something")
> something
#+end_src

Is global-flycheck-mode installed?
temporarily comment out this line in user-pack/config/core.el:

;; This will cause "Zoning.." problem if flycheck is not installed (package-install)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

then do m-x package-install ret flycheck

might have to persuade it to look on melpa as well as elpa

This is the original image link which works on github but displays the image too wide in emacs *impatient-showdown-mode*
![Project Screen](docs/screenshots/projects.png?raw=true)

Both of these can be used to fix that
![Project Screen](docs/screenshots/projects.png?raw=true =800x500)
<img src=docs/screenshots/projects.png width=100%/>
#+end_src

the *raw=true* was needed by github to correctly display relative links. I don't think it is necessary anymore except when linking an image from inside [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#relative-links][an issue, PR, or comment]]

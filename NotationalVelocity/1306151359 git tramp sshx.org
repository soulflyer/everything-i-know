#+TITLE: git tramp sshx
# TAGS #ssh #emacs

tramp doesn't seem to work on default settings. I think it is my .profile setting PS1 to something it can't recognise. Using sshx as the connection method gets round this:
C-x C-f /sshx:jphuquoc@soulflyer.co.uk:filename
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html#Frequently-Asked-Questions
add this?:
(setq tramp-default-method "sshx")
yes, but this then breaks mimi, which needs ssh not sshx

soulflyer prompt now modified so it has a $ on the end. Works ok.

C-x C-f /ssh:jphuquoc@soulflyer.co.uk:filename

C-x C-d /ssh:mimi.local:

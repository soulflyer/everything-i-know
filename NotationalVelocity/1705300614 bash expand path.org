also this, but readlink --canonicalize doesn't work on Mac OSX :

# The path you want to get information on... (for readability)
your_path=..

# Using /bin/readlink (resolves symlinks)
export SRC_DIR=$(readlink --canonicalize $your_path)

# Using /usr/bin/dirname (keeps symlinks)
export SRC_DIR=$(cd $your_path ; pwd)

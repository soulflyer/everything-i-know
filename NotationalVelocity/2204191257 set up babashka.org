#+TITLE: set up babashka
# Tags #clojure #babashka

Need to have a bb.edn file to use requires that come with babashka like these:
#+begin_src clojure
(require '[clojure.java.shell :as sh]
         '[cheshire.core :as json])
#+end_src

It must contain a map, but the map can be empty

Jacking in works, but complains about not knowing what the version of clojure is, and that there is no project. Adding a deps.edn file likle this fixes it, but breaks compilation:
#+begin_src clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.1"}}}
#+end_src
This isn't surprising, babashka is not clojure...

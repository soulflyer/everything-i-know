Covers hand tool skills, mixture of woodblock prints and photos. 
Good copy, [[file:~/Documents/books/bookshelf/Woodwork/Old-Books/handworkinwood00noyerich.pdf][handworkinwood00noyerich.pdf]], 
yellow would need to be corrected, but no intrusive watermarks.

[[pdf:/Volumes/bookshelf/Woodwork/Old-Books/1912-HandworkInWood-ne.pdf::1++0.00][1912-HandworkInWood-ne.pdf]] Is white and easily readable. Also doesn't trigger the out of focus bug in *Preview*

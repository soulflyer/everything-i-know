there is an example at the end of how to not use the deprecated *pop-up-windows*

checkout shackle.el (melpa), in particular *(shackle-trace-functions)* to observe calls to display-buffer. Look in buffer *shackle-trace*

I don't know why *Org links* won't behave. It always splits the window 50:50 and ignores atttempts to use display-buffer-alist entries to modify its behaviour.
Editing the src of *(org-insert-link)* in *ol.el* by adding *(resize-temp-buffer-window)* helps but it isn't a permanent solution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-current-buffer "*Org Links*"
	(erase-buffer)
	(insert "Insert a link.
Use TAB to complete link prefixes, then RET for type-specific completion support\n")
	(when org-stored-links
	  (insert "\nStored links are available with <up>/<down> or M-p/n \
\(most recent with RET):\n\n")
	  (insert (mapconcat #'org-link--prettify
			     (reverse org-stored-links)
			     "\n")))
        (resize-temp-buffer-window)
	(goto-char (point-min)))
#+end_src

Here is info about a patch that will hopefully be applied eventually:
§2109271033 hide org-links buffer
Looks like it has been applied. Not sure if it will allow control of the display or just hiding it altogether.

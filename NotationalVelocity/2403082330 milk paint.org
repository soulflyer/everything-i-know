[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint3.png]]Add the lemon juice to milk
[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint4.png]]After filtering the whey through a canvas, a cream remains and constitutes the base for the milk paint
[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint5.png]]The base is transparent and can be used for painting the internal parts of the chest and drawers
[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint6.png]]I began preparing a blue paint by using a concentrated pigment for wall paint. Of course you can use a powder
[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint7.png]]The green color is obtained by mixing blue paint with yellow powder

[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint9.png]]Three to four coats of green paint have been necessary to achieve full coverage of the surface

[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint12.png]]All holders for lid and drill box tools are treated with a mixture of mineral spirits and linseed oil
[[file:2403082330 milk paint-images/paint13.png]]Two large handles are used to transport the tool chest. They are secured in place with countersunk machine screws. The nuts on the inner side are hidden by drawer runners

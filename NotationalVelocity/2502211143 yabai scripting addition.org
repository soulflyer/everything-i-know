[[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(latest-release)][install latest release]] has instructions for automatically running *sudo yabai --load-sa*

When editing */private/etc/sudoers.d/yabai* do this:
#+begin_src shell
# input the line below into the file you are editing.
#  replace <yabai> with the path to the yabai binary (output of: which yabai).
#  replace <user> with your username (output of: whoami). 
#  replace <hash> with the sha256 hash of the yabai binary (output of: shasum -a 256 $(which yabai)).
#   this hash must be updated manually after upgrading yabai.

<user> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: sha256:<hash> <yabai> --load-sa
#+end_src

Mine is missing the *sha* part, so check on next reboot and add it if it hasn't run ok.

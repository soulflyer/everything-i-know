Edits in eclipse do not appear in the new build. Need to go to the terminal and do:

cordova build

then try running the project TWICE. First time the old version will run. Second time the edits just made will take effect. 

Go figure.......

no such problems editing in eclipse then running:

cordova build
adb install -r ........

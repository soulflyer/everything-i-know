#+TITLE: bash parameter substitution
# TAGS #bash

Useful for modifying a variable containing a path ie to remove the first part of a path:

FULLSIZE_DIR=/Users/iain/Pictures/Published/fullsize
SUBPATH=${TESTFILE##$FULLSIZE_DIR/}

will return just the 2017/05/projectname/image part of a complete path to an image

this could also be done using sed:

echo $TESTFILE | sed s~$FULLSIZE_DIR~~ | sed s~^/~~

Note: using ~ as the delimiter in the sed command as it won't be in the pathname, as long as it has been expanded previously with stat:

export FULLSIZE_DIR=$(stat -f %N $FULLSIZE_DIR)

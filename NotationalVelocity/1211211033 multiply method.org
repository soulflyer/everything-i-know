To multiply two decimal numbers x and y, write them next to each other, as in the example below. Then repeat the following: divide the first number by 2, rounding down the result (that is, dropping the .5 if the number was odd), and double the second number. Keep going till the first number gets down to 1. Then strike out all the rows in which the first number is even, and add up whatever remains in the second column.

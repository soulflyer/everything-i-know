#+TITLE: clojure seesaw start jvm problem
# TAGS #clojure #seesaw

from the repl-tutorial:

;    $ lein new hello-seesaw
;    $ cd hello-seesaw
;    $ edit project.clj and add [seesaw "1.4.2"] to :dependencies
;    $ lein deps

; Now let's start up the REPL and do some Seesaw stuff. Repl results are
; marked with ;=> in the usual way.
$ lein repl

; Here we go. First will use Seesaw and stuff
(use 'clojure.repl)
;=> nil
(use 'seesaw.core)
;=> nil

If the cider-nrepl plugin is in use, this doesn't start up the jvm as it should (main doesn't appear after doing (use 'seesaw.core) as it should.

Fix by adding seesaw to the ns defn, ie:

(ns junk.core
  (:use seesaw.core))
  
  
and add a :main clause to the defproject definition.

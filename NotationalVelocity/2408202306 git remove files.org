*git-filter-repo* Install with *brew*

#+begin_src shell
git filter-repo --invert-paths --force --path downloads/ReCycle_224_Full.dmg
#+end_src

Removed this file that had ended up in the wrong downloads directory and was stopping me from pushing to origin (github)

Had problems doing this twice. Needed to do this:
#+begin_src shell
git update-ref -d refs/original/refs/heads/main
#+end_src
to get past this error:
Cannot create a new backup.
A previous backup already exists in refs/original/

Then do these 
#+begin_src shell
git config pull.rebase true
git pull
git push origin main>
#+end_src

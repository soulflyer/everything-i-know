#+TITLE: org-capture in the same window
# Tags #emacs #org-mode

Need to redefine 2 fns so everything happens in the same window. Might be better to use advice if I can figure out how. Meanwhile just redefining *org-capture-fill-template*, *org-capture-place-template* and *org-mks* by replacing calls to *org-switch-to-buffer-other-window* with *org-pop-to-buffer-same-window*. 
=NOTE= they need to be defined in that order (or at least org-capture-fill-template before org-capture-place-template) or org-capture-place-template will call the original unmodified version of org-capture-fill-template.
Considered doing the same for *org-insert-link* but it is useful to keep the original file on screen and the *Org Links* buffer gets tidied away after use.

Some thoughts on ways to override an emacs lisp function: [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/15725437/1671119][Stack Overflow]]
This answer has an alternative method which uses advice but only has code to modify a single function call inside the original method: [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/54251825/1671119][Stack Overflow answer]]
*with-eval-after-load* is useful here [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21880139/what-is-with-eval-after-load-in-emacs-lisp][Stack Exchange]]

  TABLE is the alist which should contain entries where the car is a string.
  There should be two types of entries.

  1. prefix descriptions like (\"a\" \"Description\")
     This indicates that `a' is a prefix key for multi-letter selection, and
     that there are entries following with keys like \"ab\", \"ax\"...

  2. Select-able members must have more than two elements, with the first
     being the string of keys that lead to selecting it, and the second a
     short description string of the item.

  The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
  that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
  prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
  When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)
  under this key will be shown and offered for selection.

  TITLE will be placed over the selection in the temporary buffer,
  PROMPT will be used when prompting for a key.  SPECIALS is an
  alist with (\"key\" \"description\") entries.  When one of these

CHDK won't boot unless you do this:
#+begin_src shell
cd /Volumes/CANON_DC
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine DISKBOOT.BIN PS.FI2
#+end_src
(might be FIS instead of FI2)

Had to create a FAT16 partition by hand. Using CHDK utilities didn't work and disk-utility wont create a FAT16 file system on an 8G card:
#+begin_src shell
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v MYSDCARD -b 4096 -c 128 /dev/disk4s1
#+end_src
4G is wasted space but I don't think it is worth the hassle of trying to get dual partitions to work.

Next problem is that the alt button no longer works to change aperture size in manual mode. Given the limitations of this camera this may not be such a big deal. Using P mode and adjusting the exposure might be the best way to go anyway.

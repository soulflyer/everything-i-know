* Angle division
Bisection is easy, as is trisection of 90° but other angles are tricky. Most practical method that doesn't involve using a protractor would seem to be this from [[https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TrisectionBySlidingALine/][wolfram]]:

The distance *OA* is marked and the parallel and the perpendicular drawn. Then the ruler which is marked at *C* and *D* where *CD* is double *OA* is moved until it passes through *O* while keeping *C* on the perpendicular and *O* on the parallel.

Another possibility is the *Tomahawk* method [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection#cite_ref-trisectors_1-0][(wikipedia)]]:

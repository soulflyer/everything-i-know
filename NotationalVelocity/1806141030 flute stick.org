Walking stick flute – DECKER, Joseph

We’re back with another fascinating and extremely rare walking stick instrument. This three-part marvel was made by the Bavarian master turner and instrument workshop of Joseph DECKER.  It’s maybe from the mid-1800s. Very little is known about Joseph Decker and few of his instruments are known to exist. We do know that his son, Joseph, worked alongside his father. This is very likely to be the same cane flute mentioned in the Langwill Index.

The walking stick is made of plumwood and has a chic bamboo look, which was typical of the time. The pommel is made of wood which was stained black – it can be screwed on and off. The rings are crafted in horn. The tip or ferrule is made of brass. It has one brass key with a pewter plug. [Yep! It works.]

There’s even a chain which it easy to hold or carry the stick… without dropping it!

This walking stick flute is in great shape overall! It has a tiny hairline crack on the pommel, but it plays beautifully at the pitch of a=443 Hz.

This could be your go-to musical accessoire, a highlight of your collection or simply a fun and unique flute to enjoy playing – and impress everyone else!

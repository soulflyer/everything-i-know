#!/bin/bash
if [ -n "$SSH_CLIENT" ] || [ -n "$SSH_TTY" ]; then
  emacsclient -a "" -t "$@"
else
  emacsclient -a "" -c "$@"
fi

The script creates an emacs frame in the current terminal if it is called from an SSH session, otherwise it creates a new GUI Emacs frame. Suppose you save it at ~/bin/ec, you can then set the EDITOR environment variable to $HOME/bin/ec in your shell.

#+TITLE: tmux sessions
# TAGS #tmux

If there are multiple sessions then send-keys needs the session to be specified. ie:

tmux send-keys -t dev:$LABEL.1 'ec ./Code' C-m
tmux send-keys -t dev:$LABEL.2 'ec ~/Documents/org-mode ; bash -l' C-m

from .tmux/startup

I don't think this is a problem usually, but it is possible for a new session to be started and saved by tmux-resurrect. Check with:

tmux list-sessions

Really need to clean up the tm codebase to check for things like this.

Like this:
SESSION=`tmux display-message -p "#S"`
tmux send-keys -t $SESSION:$LABEL.1 'ec ./Code' C-m

Just needs adding to any custom .tmux files, and probably the one created by tm -n

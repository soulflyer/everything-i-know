qmv
installed by:
brew install renameutils

from https://bluz71.github.io/2018/03/15/bash-shell-tweaks-tips.html
By default, qmv will use two editor columns, in my experience this consumes too much valuable real-estate for little benefit, hence, I recommend the following Bash alias (force destination-only):

alias qmv='qmv -f do'
Usage
qmv **/*.JPG # rename to lowercase '.jpg' extension via substitution
qmv *.old    # rename to '.BAK' extension also via substitution

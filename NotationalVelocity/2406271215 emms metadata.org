#+TITLE: emms metadata
# Tags #emms

Mark tracks in the play buffer with *m* and then hit *E* to open the tag editing buffer.
use *emms-tag-editor-set-all* bound to *C-c C-r* to set tags like year etc that apply to all the tracks, and *C-c C-c* to save and exit.

Use *emms-mark-all* but delete the lines that aren't tracks first.

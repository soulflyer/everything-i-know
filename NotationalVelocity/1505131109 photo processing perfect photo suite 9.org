Cons:
Not very responsive.
Edits are one off. Looks like once applied, thats it. Only option is to delete and redo in a new layer

Pros:
Perfect Portrait for touching up faces. Fast to use, but the speedup is all lost by waiting for the program to respond.
Layers and masks looks promising

Overall FAIL

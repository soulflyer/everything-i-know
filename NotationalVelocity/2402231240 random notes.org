* Utilities Module

[[file:2402231240 random notes-images/patch1.png]]

The utilities module produces a random output

Sending a clock or trigger to the TRIG input, with no signal patched into the IN input generates a stepped random signal. The output level is calibrated such that more than half of the time, the output value is between -2V and +2V ; and it very, very rarely goes below -5V or above +5V.

patch is [[file:~/Documents/Rack2/patches/downloads/random_melodies.vcv][here]]

* Clock dividers

Not exactly random, but close enough. Sequence is fed into the clock divider and then a sample and hold so only certain steps get triggered:

Can use different divisions of the same sequence to trigger different voices. Details [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiLnZ5vOzM4&list=PLiECaNQx239tD6qSspeLhMKvhdUK1TE4U&index=4][here]].
Video also contains details of using a clock divider on cv signals to generate a sequence like this:

The clock feedback technique is described earlier in the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiLnZ5vOzM4&t=727s][video]], in its simplest form it looks like this:

Not sure exactly how it works, but it depends on the inverted feedback signal messing with the clock. The clock looks the same on the scope apart from a downward blip when the clock division that is being fed back happens. Makes for some useful patterns that are not random at all.

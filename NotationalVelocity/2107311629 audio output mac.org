Click the plus button at the bottom left corner and select Create Aggregate Device. Name it BlackHole Audio Input and select the BlackHole 16 Channel.
Create another aggregate device by clicking the plus button again and select Multi-Output Device. Name it Screen Recording with Audio and ensure it includes your speakers and the BlackHole device.

** Step 3: Configure Audio Settings

Go to System Settings > Sound > Output, and select the Screen Recording with Audio device you created.

** Step 4: Start Recording

Press Shift + Command + 5 to open the Screenshot toolbar. In the Options menu, select the BlackHole Audio Input as your microphone and start recording.
Step 5: Stop Recording

To end the recording, click the Stop button on the menu bar or press Command + Control + Escape.

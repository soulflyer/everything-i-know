#+TITLE: git squash
# TAGS #git

To squash the last 3 commits into one:

git reset --soft HEAD~3
git commit -m "New message for the combined commit"

soft reset doesn't change any of the files and they all appear as changes to be committed.
commit and push, using + to force upstream to accept the rewritten history if the branch was previously pushed

git push origin +name-of-branch

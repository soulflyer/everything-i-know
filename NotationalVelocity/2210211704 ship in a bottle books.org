Some useful drawings. Book is familiar, I think I borrowed it from Mere Green Library. This one is where I learnt to use putty instead of plasticene. Recommends using *Prussian Blue* oil colour, possibly a little *viridian* to add some green for costal waters.
Also recommends use of clear nail varnish.

* John Leopard, Ships in Bottles

Also familiar, but too recent (1990). Maybe recycling ideas from earlier books? Has the idea of using a broken needle eye as a dolphin striker. Pretty sure I saw and used that, but that would have been pre 1977.
A few good bits but fairly short. Good drawings at the end in the *Projects* section. Topsail schooner in particular.

Facebook post from Eric Haas

"Come out and experience this stunning matched pair of traversos by the legendary Friedrich von Huene (after traverso c. 1720 by Peter Bressan). Flutists Peter H. Bloom and Naama Lion join Carol Lewis (viola da gamba) and Chris Henriksen (theorbo and baroque guitar) Friday March 8 at 8 pm in Cambridge and Sunday March 10 at 3 pm in Somerville. Special thanks to Eric Haas for lending the instrument that Na’ama is playing. https://www.facebook.com/events/3720217581527202

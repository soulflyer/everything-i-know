** shaping
Introduces the concept of *shaping*, which is defining a task at a level that is sufficient to anticipate problems but leaves freedom for creative solutions. The shaping phase happens before development and is done by a small team or an individual. End product is a *pitch* which contains:
- problem 
- Appetite
- Solution - a sketch
- Rabbit Holes - what might cause problems
- No-gos - what we had to rule out in order to stay within the appetite.

** Appetite
How long do we want to spend on this? This seems to be a central concept. Focussing on it has to be a good idea as it will prevent or limit sidetracks and task expansion.


** Hill charts
Chart. Looks like a hill. Plots progress. Left side is working out what to do, right side is doing it. Supposedly good for spotting blockers.

#+TITLE: emacs gui resize
# Tags #emacs

from [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus#emacs-29-1][emacs-plus]]
GUI Emacs window not filling the whole screen can be fixed with:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+end_src

also 

can get rid of title bar by adding the following line in your early-init.el file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated . t))
#+end_src

Looks good but can't drag the window, must use yabai/skhd

note that emacs will accept lowercase although the actual names are UPPERCASE
Also note that cutting and pasting screws up the inserted char.

The trumps are not particularly useful, having little relationship to the tarot trumps.

** Arrows
revisit these at some point. ATM text mode displays them full width, but overlapping the next char. Adding a space betwen makes them look right. GUI mode doesn't need the space and adding it distorts the diagram.

§2109111443 Abbreviations, Not as fast as direct keybinds.

** Notes
Note that terminal doesn't set fonts like gui emacs. They need to be set in the profile options for iTerm. Currently set there to monaco and symbola for the non ascii characters which appears to work reasonably well.

Some info came from http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_index.html
Installed juliamono font and set it as the standard (and fixedwidth) font in the browser to get it to display more characters. Still doesn't get all of them.

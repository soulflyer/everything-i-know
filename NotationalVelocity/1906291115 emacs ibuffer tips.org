just do a refresh *g* to get them back

*,* steps through various sorting methods

*t* toggles marks

*=* on a modified buffer shows the differences between the buffer and the file

Save a filter group with */g* then add it to the display with */a* ?
*/v /i /g* seems to do it. Not sure what */a* does

Once the buffer filters are saved as a group, */R* will switch to the saved group

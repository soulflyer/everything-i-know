#+TITLE: skhd not running
# Tags #mac

After a crash and running *brew-upgrade* to try and fix the mess, *skhd* wasn't starting
#+begin_src shell
skhd --start-service
#+end_src
fixed it. Needed to allow it in the security settings. Although it looked like it was already there, another instane appeared in the list, with a shell icon, and that had to be allowed.

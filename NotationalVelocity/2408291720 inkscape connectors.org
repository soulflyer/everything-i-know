Useful for creating wiring diagrams like this one:

The process is not exactly obvious:

- Ungroup the end connectors from the device *Shift Command G*
- create the connection using the *connector tool* (press *o*)
- make sure the correct connection point is visible in the tooltip when clicking for the start and releasing for the end
- Re-group by drag selecting the device and its connection boxes then press *Command G*

To adjust when this goes wrong, which it often seems to do 

- Un-group
- Select the connector
- Select the *connector tool*
- Drag the little white squares to the correct place, watch for the tiny white box to go green.
- Re-group

Useful commands inside *termux*:
apt
pkg
termux-change-repo

had to install *clang* and *binutils* to get apl configure to run. Failed with "doc/DALY/Makefile.in not found" Makefile.in is not in that dir. Added a symbolic link. Also a couple of other subdirs needed this.

Installed *make*
which failed trying to look in DALY directory that didn't exist.

[[https://android.stackexchange.com/a/187580][Stack Exchange]] answer suggesting installing arch to get a full dev env. Didn't work for me.

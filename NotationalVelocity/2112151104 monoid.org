“a bunch of things” and “some way of combining them”

A monoid is a system (combining function and set of things to combine) that obeys 3 rules

** closure
If a function returns something of the same type it has closure
** associativity
If order doesn't matter the fn is associative
** identity element
An element that can be combined with another and return the same value

An example would be *Addition on the set of Integers*

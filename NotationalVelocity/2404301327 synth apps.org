* *Vintage* 
is a free standalone emulation of a vintage hardwired synth from Behringer. (vst)
* *Bespoke*  
is a modular synth that looks a lot like a visual programming language. [[https://www.bespokesynth.com/][bespoke]]
Seems to handle screen use in a non conventional way, taking over the laptop screen. Try hitting *?* a couple of times. The first time should show the internal menus, and the second time turn the window into a regular mac window that can be dragged onto the big screen.
* Virtual Acoustic Modelling

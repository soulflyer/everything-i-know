Gui emacs, won't work in terminal:

try (setq openwith-associations nil) C-x C-e
The openwith associations cause the images to be opened externaly rather than inline.

C-c C-x C-v to toggle inline image display

Linux waits for the external app to close. Using openwith and providing =eog&= as the guess works correctly

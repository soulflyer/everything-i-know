Richard Arnold post. Cramps have stamp "T.Hughes"

What’s on the bench today? 
While I was at the last David Stanley auction a very good friend donated these wonderful wooden cramps to add to the museum wall. They are beautifully constructed from beech, Mahogany, boxwood, and brass. I particularly like the brass locking pin mechanism backed up with the locking boxwood wedges. I have a suspicion that they were made for sash window making. There are a number of owners marks on them , but I suspect that the small and very neat mark of “T Hughes” may have been the original owner, and maker. Now I just need to find some space on the wall for them!

Also this, found on facebook:

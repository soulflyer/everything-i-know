pi works as an abbreviation, set using *add-global-abbrev* after the symbol then inserting it with *expand-abbrev*
degree also works but insists on including something before it, but that can be deleted in the table of abbreviations.

C-x a g          records an abbreviation
C-x a e          expands a previously recorded one..
M-x (list-abbrevs) shows all the recorded abbreviations

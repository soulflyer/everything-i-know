Local copy of clojure library

git clone overtone source
run lein install
change ns dependancy in the dependant project to [overtone "0.10-SNAPSHOT"]

without the lein install lein will go to clojars and pull 0.10-SNAPSHOT from there.

For image-lib, do lein install in the image-lib dir, then C-c C-k to recompile when it changes. Other project with image-lib as a requirement should automatically get the changes.

#+TITLE: docker delete
# Tags #docker

Delete in *Docker Desktop* doesn't actually delete anything. Do this instead:
#+begin_src shell
docker compose down --rmi all && docker volume rm <volume name>
#+end_src
get the volume name under the Volumes screen. It's not the same name as the one visible under containers/apps

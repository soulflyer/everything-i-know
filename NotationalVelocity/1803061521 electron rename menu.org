#+TITLE: electron rename menu
# TAGS #electron

For mac osx, menu title is taken from the app name, so rename the app in the .plist file of the version of electron used to run the app.
This might be in node-modules or elswhere depending on how it is called in the project.

in Electron.app/Contents/info.plist:

change:
#+begin_src xml

	<key>CFBundleName</key>
#+end_src
to the desired title

The name in the doc (hover) is set by the name of the app. or by changing CFDisplayName

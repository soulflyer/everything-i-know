will search metadata but it's really slow and doesn't seem to be able to pull out a list, ie it finds one, then you have to click find again and wait another 5 minutes to see the next one.
Might be able to do this with filters...
try %c matches *listen*

MusicBrainz Picard:
seems ok for manipulating metadata but can't search through the comments field. Looks like it could do a great job of finding and correcting metadata problems.

Used about 20g of chopped up dried ginger. Could use more.
Used around 200g of cane sugar. Probably about right althought the biscuits didn't spread as expected. Cooking time was a bit longer than expected too. I think our oven may not be reaching the temperature it says on the dial.

2nd Batch:
40g chopped up dried ginger
175g of cane sugar syrup
about 5 teaspoons of baking powder.
Flattened them out more this time.
Cooked on full blast. Still takes longer than the recipe suggests.

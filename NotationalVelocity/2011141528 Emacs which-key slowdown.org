So, I just found out that disabling which-key-mode in Emacs significantly reduces the latency (by like 30%). 
Now, I'm wondering if I even need it on all the time.
Or maybe I should try tweaking some which-key vars?

I have been using `which-key` this way:

(setq which-key-show-early-on-C-h t)
(setq which-key-idle-delay 10000)
(setq which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05)
(which-key-mode)

Therefore, the which-key pane only appears if I hit C-h explicitly. C-c <C-h> for example

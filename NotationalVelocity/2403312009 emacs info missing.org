#+TITLE: emacs info missing
# Tags #emacs

None of the info nodes for emacs were showing up. Turns out the *dir* file was missing in the main directory, */opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-head@29/29.2_1/share/info/emacs*
Sorted it with this:
#+begin_src shell
cd /opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-head@29/29.2_1/share/info/emacs
for f in *.info.gz; do install-info $f dir; done
#+end_src
NOTE: won't work in *eshell*

ALSO need to set INFOPATH to point to the info file:
#+begin_src shell
export INFOPATH="~/.info:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-head@29/29.2_1/share/info/emacs"
#+end_src

<2025-03-06 Thu> Found exactly the same answer [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport/issues/242#issuecomment-1257139899][here]]. Should have looked in my notes :-/

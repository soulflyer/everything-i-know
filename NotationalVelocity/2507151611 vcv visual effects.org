There was a name change at some point. Its the same module. 
Limited to the rack unit window, but immediate and easy to use. Just turn the knobs or send it some CVs to change the display.

Intro video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0nHmBzQoA][here]] has no sound and cables are set to invisible. My attempt at recreating it looks like this:

However the *load* function on the *ImageIn* module is not working so I don't know if I got it right. [[file:~/Code/vcvrack/patches/Vision-Experiment.vcv][Patch is here]]
Also it seems to stop *VCV* from running. I guess its waiting for response from a file select dialog I can't see. Update to 2.1.1 didn't help.
It is a known [[https://github.com/silver-ag/visions/issues/4][Issue]]

A real rabbithole. Lots of pretty images, but it isn't at all obvious how they respond to sound. Does allow for display in a separate window by using the *LFMFull* rather than the *LFMEmbedded* module. Rather a ot of presets and I'm not certain the module always respects the preset change settings.
Had some sucess using an extra send from the mixer and carefully setting the send level. Used the *Zylot* patches ie *Azirphaeli's Mirror*. *The Inner Workings of My New Computer* shows distinctly different effects according to the levels on the left and right inputs.
*nil, can't stop the blithering* is interesting, trees sprouting out of the ground. Seems to be a longish cycle and not obvious how anything affects it other than the *gradient* control. If that is set too low then nothing is visible.

Does Fourier Analysis, but can look quite pretty.

Tricky to figure out what to do with the various inputs and options but may have potential.

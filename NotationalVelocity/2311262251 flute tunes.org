Starts on an f# which makes it tough. Way easier if it starts on E. Either find an C whistle (I think) or run it at *0.89* speed or drop the pitch by *2 semitones* to get it in tune for a D whistle.
This might be the wrong way round, ie should be an E whistle to give F# as the 5 finger note.

Whistle starts at just after *25 seconds*.

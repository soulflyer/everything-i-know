* Transposing a whole patch

I like the *Befaco* *Voltio* as a master pitch changer because of the large knob with the note names around it. However the range doesn't suit the *Bogaudio* *Stack* which seems to be the obvious choice for a transposer. Feeding it through a *Bogaudio* *Offset* first with the scale set to =1.2= fixes that, and everything transposes correctly:

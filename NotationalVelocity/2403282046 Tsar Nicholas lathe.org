From a facebook post my Robertsonminiatures to Ornamental Turners International:

This is Tsar Nicholas I (1796 - 1855) rose engine lathe. It is in the Technisches Museum Wien, the Museum of Technology in Vienna, Austria. Turning on the lathe was hobby of kings, queens and royalty from the 16th to mid 19th centuries throughout the courts in Europe.
This lathe was built after about 1825 according to the caption and has many features described in Bergeron’s book Manual du Tourneur (2nd edition, 1816). It has a transverse spindle for threading, a forward mounted rosette and a rear mounted plate for possible swash or mediation work. It appears to be mounted with a double eccentric oval chuck.
Behind the headstock is some sort of drive that I am not sure just what all it did. It appears there was also a overhead and my have been similar to that shown in Diderot’s encyclopedia (1772). Sadly with so many of these early machines, many of the parts used with them are now missing. I have not found any details of this lathe, the museum’s inventory number is 11028.

These are not the only possibilities, but adopted here.

* outer layers
L R U D F B

* double outer layers
l r u d f b

* multiple outer layers
Use underline so _2R_ is the same as r
_3R_ is the outer 3 layers etc.

* inner layers
M is the centre layer between R and L, no specific shortcuts for the layers between U and D or F and B. Direction is ambiguous, I assume the direction as seen from the right. Most times it doesn't matter. If it does, use the number prefix notation:
3R is the 3rd layer in from the right etc.

* rotations
x pitch forwards around an axis parallel to the horizon
y
z

* modifiers
' means reverse. The normal rotation is clockwise if facing directly towards the face being moved. Add ' and it is anticlockwise.

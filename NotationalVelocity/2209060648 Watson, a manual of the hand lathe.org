pdf, but looks like it was a conversion from another ebook format:
[[file:~/Documents/books/bookshelf/Turning/A-Manual-of-the-Hand-Lathe-_-Comprising-Concise-Directions-for-Working-Meta.pdf][A manual of the hand lathe]]

Some good stuff on hand turning metal. A very disorganised book though, skips from one topic to another.

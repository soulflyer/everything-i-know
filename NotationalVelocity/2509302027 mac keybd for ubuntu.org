[[https://askubuntu.com/a/1423769/960653][Stack Exchange Answer]] on tilde fix

#+begin_src text
The answer from Zanna wasn't working for me, but this answer was. So in my case I had to create /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf and set its contents to:

options hid_apple iso_layout=0

I also wanted the F keys to work like regular F1-F12 keys so I also added

options hid_apple fnmode=2

This worked after rebooting my computer.
#+end_src

This partially worked for me in that now the fn keys behave correctly, but the tilde key doesn't
I think this may be the correct behaviour. The tilde char appears when pressing the \ key next to return. Possibly the keyboard was already being seen as ISO layout.

Aug 7,  2020 Started cutting pieces for wheel arches in toolbox.
Aug 8,  2020 More stock prep for toolbox wheel arches. All pieces ripped out and face side and edge prepped. Hit a nail thicknessing. Resharpened and completed dirt removal but not all the thicknessing.
Aug 9,  2020 Reground jack plane iron to remove nicks from yesterdays nail hit. It now has a slight camber in the grind. Finished thicknessing and cut all the tails in one go. Used new Stanley crosscut, works well but is a bit coarse for dovetails. Cut and fitted the first 2 sets of pins.
Aug 10, 2020 Cut the remaining 2 sets of pins for the wheel arches. Cut the first 2 sliding dovetail housings in the front panel of the toolbox. Not sure if this is the best way to do this but it should work ok doing the female part first. Arches can then be fitted and slid into place after the main carcass is assembled.

Created a style with 2 Contrast-Brightness-Saturation modules with different parametric masks and a levels module to remove the shadows without losing text.
Aug 20, 2020 Darktable crashing regularly but usually stays up long enough to apply the style to a bunch of pages. building the new document in libreoffice. Up to pg 270 now.
Aug 21, 2020 Cleaned up some of the dovetails on the toolchest.
Aug 22, 2020 Finished cleanup and recessed the wheel axle nuts and washers.

Aug 27, 2020 Made a thicker spacing piece for the kerfing plane and adjusted the holes in the body. It will now do more than 3 inches.
Aug 28, 2020 Cut One piece for one long and one short lower edge of the toolchest. Bowsaw is blunt, not cutting any faster than the baby rip. Resharpened bowsaw and kerfing plane. Added a little set to the kerfing plane. May need a tiny bit more, its still prone to stick.
Aug 29, 2020 Cut the other pieces for the lower skirt of the toolchest. Added a bit more set to the kerfing plane. Seems about right. Still has some tendency to stick, but not as bad. I suspect it could do with smaller teeth.
Aug 30, 2020 Cleaned up all 4 pieces of the lower skirt. Scrub plane works beautifully just before it stops working altogether because it is too blunt. Seems that the clearance wears off so it cuts like a spokeshave leaving a really good surface. 10 mins later and it won't cut at all, so resharpen it and its back to being it's usual vicious bastard self, leaving tearout.
Sep 1,  2020 Squared up the pieces for the lower skirt of the toolchest.
Sep 3,  2020 Marked and cut and rough fitted the first skirt dovetail
Sep 4,  2020 Finished fitting the 1st dovetail and started marking the second. Resharpened some chisels. 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 are pretty much flattened, 5/8 and 1 still very slightly convex, probably from being flattened on a non flat stone.
Sep 5,  2020 Sharpened the tenon saw, used Nham's magnifier lamp. Made a new handle for her suitcase.
Sep 6,  2020 Completed dovetails for skirt and prepared for glue up.
Sep 7,  2020 Glued up lower skirt.
Sep 8,  2020 There are some gaps along the upper edge of the lower skirt. Should have checked more carefully, not easily visible with the carcass upside down. Used the failed veneer saw experiment to clean out and widen the gaps ready for a strip of wood to fill them.
Sep 10, 2020 Trying out lid designs
Sep 11, 2020 Marked out pieces for toolchest lid. Started sewing joints book
Sep 12, 2020 Finished sewing joints book. Glued and cut it.
Sep 14, 2020 Started cutting stock for lid pieces.
Oct 5,  2020 Completed preparing pdf for Holtzapffel 4. Involved getting rid of the shadows using darktable, but this doesn't like the jpegs extracted from the original pdf and crashes regularly. Used aperture to crop and straighten and then darktable to process the pages to remove the shadow. Only doing a few at a time seemed to help but the crashes were unpredictable. Re-assembled the pages using open-office. Sadly this will not print out signatures except by chopping the document into 16 page documents, so.... Export as pdf and use acrobat to print the signatures.
Oct 6,  2020 Printed out H5
Oct 7,  2020 Sewed H5

Nov 5,  2020 Fitted centre pieces of toolchest lid.
Nov 6,  2020 Cut 2 small crosspieces of toolchest lid, incl tenons and rebates.
Nov 7,  2020 Marked out mortices for small crosspieces. Improved the fitting of the main joints.
Nov 8,  2020 Cut mortices. Got mixed up and ended up with one on the wrong side (fixed by turning the upright around and refitting the joints) and off by an inch on the other one. Glued up the 4 centre joints.
Nov 9,  2020 Glued up remaining pieces of toolchest lid frame.
Nov 11, 2020 Prepared stock for lid hinge edge.
Nov 16, 2020 Made a scratchstock.
Nov 18, 2020 Made 1/2in concave and convex blade for scratchstock. Made a sample hinge joint to check it works ok for the toolchest.
Nov 21, 2020 After much thinking decided to go with plan A. A simpler, hinge on the outside, design would leave a gap that would be difficult to clear and not provide support to the open lid. Started to cut the rebate in the back piece for the lid edge. Made a base for the large router so its easier to use when there is only a small area to support the base.
Nov 23, 2020 Sanded and oiled the router base.
Nov 24, 2020 Cut recesses for the hinges in lid edge piece.
Nov 25, 2020 First fit of hinged lid piece.
Nov 26, 2020 Fixed edge to lid.
Nov 27, 2020 Resawed some pieces for lid edge. Possibly not hard wearing enough. Maybe use some Dao instead.
Nov 28, 2020 Spent some time trying to find suitable pieces for the lid edge. Probably overthinking this as they will mostly be painted. Would be nice to have the unpainted/worn bits showing dark brown though.
Nov 30, 2020 Flood warnings. Lifted the toolchest shell onto the bench just in case.
Dec 1,  2020 Power out, and still raining. Eased off later so I brought the sawhorse into the front doorway and worked on the owl netsuke.
Dec 2,  2020 Cleaned out the workshop and lifted everything back off the bench. Cut some Dao for the toolchest lid edge. Sharpened the bowsaw first. had trouble keeping the saw cutting straight. Maybe I'm pushing it too hard.
Dec 3,  2020 Prepared the rest of the stock for the toolchest lid edge. Cut and fitted the first dovetail. Made a spring steel probe tool handle. A row of slightly oversize holes and a pointed end to the spring steel driven in worked quite well.
Dec 4,  2020 Cut and fitted second dovetail for toolchest lid edge.
Dec 5,  2020 Trimmed width of toolchest lid so its a reasonably close (not tight) fit.
Dec 6,  2020 Trimmed Graph Database book.
Dec 7,  2020 Cut last 2 dovetails for the toolchest lid edge. Almost ready to glue it on.
Dec 8,  2020 Glued hinge piece to toolchest lid.
Dec 9,  2020 Made some more button clamps and glued on the rest of the toolchest lid edge.
Dec 10, 2020 Roughly cleaned up the top surface of the chest lid. Got 5 planes to sharpen before completing this.
Dec 11, 2020 Planes all sharpened. Problem with the big try plane would seem to be due to a hogback effect on the blade from sharpening it from both sides. Solution seems to be to use the coarse stone to flatten it with the blade at right angles to the stone. It's now closer to being flat, but still a little way to go. (Caution doing this. All too easy to slice the heel of the palm) Smoothing plane has similar symptoms (corners not touching the stone), but in this case it's likely to be the result of a seriously cupped sharpening stone at some time in the past. Finished flattening the toolchest lid.
Dec 12, 2020 Sewed FORTH book, except for about 3in of the last signature...
Dec 13, 2020 Glued and cut FORTH book
Dec 14, 2020 Mostly just trying to figure out which pieces of wood I can use for the remainder of the chest. Decided on drawer sizes. The lower ones for the flute reamers and the metalwork tools can be shallower than I thought, so 4 drawers will be ok.
Dec 15, 2020 Made the hinge support piece, and the front lip. Attached the rear lip/hinge support using countersunk screws that will eventually be hidden by plugs. Cut my right thumb web when marking the end of the back lip. More than just a scratch, thought it might need stitches, but the bleeding stopped fairly quickly. Cleaned it and used a drop of superglue to hold it together.
Dec 16, 2020 Hand seems to be doing ok. Cleaned up the back surface and flattened it a bit so the back lip sits flat. Cut the 2 edge lip pieces.
Dec 17, 2020 Cut and fitted 2 dovetails and glued on the back lip edge piece.
Dec 18, 2020 Cut and fitted remaining dovetails for the lip. Split and repaired one end of the front piece. Broke under its own weight. Repaired with white glue.
Dec 19, 2020 Decided to use pins to accurately position the front piece. Managed to split the other end of the front piece. Repaired it while gluing the front piece to the chest.
Dec 20, 2020 Added the side pieces. Lid edging now all in place.
Dec 21, 2020 Started cleanup of lid. Also trying to figure out what to do next, looks like lots of resawing.
Dec 23, 2020 Started to make panel gauge. Messed up a bit, cut the recess level with the top side of the beam instead of the bottom, and forgot I had planned to make the beam 1-1/2 wide and cut it 1-1/4.
Dec 24, 2020 Fixed both problems and completed gauge for use with a pencil.
Dec 25, 2020 Made blade and wedge for the panel gauge.
Dec 26, 2020 Started to finish one of the bottom planks. Lovely crotch figure.
Dec 27, 2020 Completed finishing crotch figure bottom board. Prepped some stock for Pen to make a little table.
Dec 28, 2020 Fitted half of the bottom planks.
Dec 29, 2020 Fitted rest of the bottom planks except for the narrow end piece.
Dec 30, 2020 Resawed a piece of that wood with the intense yellow colour on the border between the sap and heart woods. Fitted it and scrubbed the bottom of the chest. Turned it back over.
Dec 31, 2020 Cut and rough fitted the first 2 lid panels.
Jan 2,  2021 Cut and rough fitted the next lid panel, Cut the last one and repaired the crack all the way along it.
Jan 3,  2021 Rough fitted last panel. Flattened their backs.
Jan 4,  2021 Fettled dad's No4 Record. Straightened and squared the front of the mouth, flattened the sole and rounded the edge of the casting where my left hand rubs. Also gave it a good clean using some vinegar, rinsed off and then oiled.
Jan 5,  2021 Cut the internal fielding on the small panels
Jan 6,  2021 Started to cut the external fielding.
Jan 7,  2021 Finished the grooves delineating the external fielding. Cut the slope on all the long edges. Back twinge so I switched from using the rebate plane to using the carpenters gouge to rough out the slopes. Cleaned up with the rebate plane. Still need to do the short edge slopes and finish off with the shoulder plane.
Jan 8,  2021 Finished off external fielding. Started making the beading. Fitted beading for 1 and a half panels.
Jan 9,  2021 Re-did beading on second panel, sizes didn't match well.
Jan 10, 2021 Finished off the beading on the 4 panels, including reducing the height of the first 2 so they are all approximately level with the surface.
Jan 11, 2021 Cut sections for the centre panel. Started to scrub them to establish the inner surface.
Jan 12, 2021 More stock preparation for centre panel.
Jan 13, 2021 Jointed and glued up centre panel.
Jan 14, 2021 Worked inner fielding and roughed out outer fielding the same width as the small panels. Bottom edge lines up, but it doesn't look right. Will need to make it wider.
Jan 15, 2021 Bit of work on the fielding, not much today though.
Jan 16, 2021 3 edges of the fielding roughly finished. Mended a small split in the fielding edge.
Jan 17, 2021 Finished off the fielding and started considering how to ensure the lid can't drop accidentally. So far it has not shown any signs of doing that but it is really heavy. Probably going to go with a loose block that locates using sawn off woodscrews.
Jan 18, 2021 Made the beading to hold the centre panel.
Jan 19, 2021 Started making the block to secure the lid open. Also bought a 30kg vice and some old Japanese style plane irons from a scrappy in Dien Khanh
Jan 20, 2021 Cleaned and reassembled the old vice.
Jan 21, 2021 Flattened base for vice. Bought some rope for beckets (and a kitten)
Jan 22, 2021 Bought bolts and fitted the vice to its base.
Jan 23, 2021 Cut the curve on the lid block. High metal work vice is pretty useful for sawing small stuff like this. I like the odd design, it keeps the thread clean.
Jan 24, 2021 Cut groove for rope in the vice base. Spliced rope loop for vice carry handle.
Jan 25, 2021 Glued up the lid block. Doesn't work with just 1 screw. Will need one in the lid too.
Jan 26, 2021 Added second screw and cleaned up the lid block. It now effectively holds the lid open. Will need reinforcing plates to stop the screws wearing out the wood. I have a bit of broken hinge that will do nicely.
Jan 27, 2021 Started on coachwhipping the vice carry handle. Forgot how tough knotting can be on the fingers...
Jan 28, 2021 Completed coachwhipping and tried out a couple of turks heads. 5 bight 6 lead tripled in the small cord looks about right. 9 b 10 L tripled in 1/3 of the light cord is too small but makes a great finger protector.
Jan 29, 2021 Tied the turks heads and completed the vice carry handle. Looks great. Test turks head is now around my patchouli bottle.
Jan 30, 2021 Started to resaw thin planks for top drawer bottom: cut the kerf for the first plank. Also sharpened the kerfing plane and tried to figure out how to make it work without jamming. Sawdust is getting stuck in the kerf. Considering the possibility of using it horizontally so the sawdust has less tendency to fall back into the kerf. This would mean rebuilding it or using it left handed. Neither of these options is appealing. Wire brush does the job for now.
Jan 31, 2021 Sawed out the first plank. Tied a manrope knot as an experiment for the becket core.
Feb 1,  2021 Surfaced and cut the guide kerf for the next plank. Started tidying with a view to moving the office into the workshop.
Feb 2,  2021 Cut second plank.
Feb 5,  2021 Cut guide slot for 3rd plank
Feb 6,  2021 Cut 3rd plank and cat proofed the yard.
Feb 7,  2021 Cut 3 planks for the drawer fronts. Chamfered the edges of the kerfing saw fence. Resawing was done with the big ripsaw I made. Seems to be cutting pretty straight now after I took a tiny bit of set off the left hand side. Also being careful to only cut a triangle and then reverse the wood and cut from the other side helps. Even if the cut is wandering a little it won't ruin anything until the cut goes past the triangle.
Feb 8,  2021 Helped Pen make a tiny table.
Feb 9,  2021 Moved the table and computer into the workshop. Made a .020in pokey thing.
Feb 12, 2021 Tied crown sinnet handle for pliers (just one, keep the other until it splits) and handle for 025in pokey thing.
Feb 15, 2021 Measured and weighed the beams in the yard. Pretty dense stuff. One of them is heavier than water.
Feb 16, 2021 Started trying to flatten a piece of 2by4 to cut planks for drawer backs. Even the toothing plane is struggling...
Feb 17, 2021 Made 2 new tuning peg handles for baby spice. 2 more of the originals had broken. Also straightened out the jaw liners of the metal vice. Was going to try filing them flat, but bending did the job faster.
Feb 18, 2021 Cut the guide kerf for a piece for the back of a drawer. This stuff is hard.
Feb 19, 2021 Cut the plank. Took hours of hard work. This stuff is too good for a drawer back. Very dense and close grained.
Feb 20, 2021 Cut another plank using some bang-lang. got enough stock to make the top drawer now. Printed and sewed typescript book.
Feb 21, 2021 Put cover on typescript book, cut the edges.
Feb 25, 2021 Mostly trying to work out what to do about non parallel chest sides. It's close enough to work but I would rather not risk the top drawer jamming.
Feb 26, 2021 Cut tapered piece to line chest so drawer sides are parallel.
Feb 27, 2021 Finished second taper piece and glued them to the inside of the chest. Used up the last of the black glue, so cleaned the pot out. Made another tuning peg for baby spice and some metal plates for the chest lid support.
Mar 2,  2021 Marked out the dovetails for the top drawer.
Mar 4,  2021 Cut the dovetails for the top drawer. Started to mark out the pins.

Mar 16, 2021 resawed some more of the rayed wood for drawer bottoms.
Mar 17, 2021 Prepared left and right runners for trinket drawer. Ripped stock for chisel separators that go between them.
Mar 18, 2021 Fitted separators for chisels in toolchest in top drawer.
Mar 19, 2021 Cut the base for the trinket drawer to go on top of the chisels.
Mar 20, 2021 Prepared stock for trinket drawer sides.
Mar 21, 2021 Cut the pins for the trinket tray.
Mar 22, 2021 Cut and fitted 2 of the dovetail joints for the trinket tray.
Mar 23, 2021 Finished the dovetails and Glued up trinket tray. In too much of a hurry to clean it up and trim it to fit, loosened some of the joints and had to re-glue. Next time wait overnight. Trimming dovetails puts a lot of stress on a joint.
Mar 24, 2021 Final fitting of trinket tray. Oiled it and put it to use.
Mar 25, 2021 Cut a plank for the sides of the second toolchest drawer.
Mar 26, 2021 Cut front back and sides of 2nd drawer to length and thickness.

Apr 10, 2021 Print postgres-sql book, start work on the pignose.
Apr 11, 2021 start sewing psql book, got the pignose working. Needs a new switch mechanism, but works now by removing the battery to turn it off.
Apr 12, 2021 Completed psql book. First time the cover is to big to make out of one piece of A4. Went to buy some wood. Came back with maybe 1/4 m3, mostly looks like satinwood (lots of ripple) but some that is probably Lim.
Apr 13, 2021 Cleaned up some of the wood, removed bolts and nails.
Apr 14, 2021 Cleaned up the rest of the wood. Straightened out the crosscut saw I bought in Metro, removed the twist. Managed to cut straight with it for the first time, cutting a piece to use for the backs of drawers 3 and 4. Stuff I cut last week is a bit harder and heavier and the wrong colour.
Apr 15, 2021 Started to cut the kerf for the new plank for the back of drawer 3. Vice handle broke, repaired it again. Made a new front face bench stop thing.
Apr 16, 2021 Cut a bit more and the handle broke again. Fixed it with a strap round the outside this time. Hopefully will hold better. Cleaned up the bench stop thingy.
Apr 17, 2021 Completed the cut for the plank for the back of drawer 3. Nice and straight. Cut the kerf for the next plank.
Apr 18, 2021 Cut the kerf for a second plank.
Apr 19, 2021 Sawed the second plank. Much sweat.
Apr 20, 2021 Cut the kerf and sawed the 3rd plank. 3-3/4in x 46-1/2in. The saw cut took 1 hour and 50 mins, didn't time the kerf cut (1.6 in^2/min)
Apr 21, 2021 Cut another section from the same beam for use as drawer bottoms.
Apr 22, 2021 Cut the kerf and sawed a plank from a piece of Bang Lang, 3in x 35in. Sawing took 15mins (7 in^2/min), kerf? Not sure. 15mins including much faffing. that other stuff may not be Bang Lang. The colour is similar, but its harder and the grain is tighter and has less detail. Cut the kerf for another piece of it 3-7/8in x 22in, took 10 solid minutes. Started to saw it and spent 30 mins before siesta time stopped me. Managed about 80% of it.
Apr 23, 2021 Completed yesterdays cut, took another 9 mins (2.2 sqin/min). Cut the kerf (10mins ish) and sawed another plank. 31mins (2.75 sqin/min) It seems that part of the reason this wood is so slow is the saw sticks. Not enough to jam, but enough to support the weight of the saw and prevent it cutting to full efficiency. Waxing the teeth (not the sides of the blade) helps. Needs to be done every 20 or so strokes. With a bit of care it could be done without even breaking rhythm. Considering running melted wax into the kerf so it happens automatically.
Apr 24, 2021 Cut another plank. Tried rubbing wax into the kerf before sawing, but it didn't seem to help. Regular touch of wax on the backstroke of the saw did though.
Messed up the timing, not sure how long this plank took, but it definitely felt easier, if not actually faster. Started looking for some blade stock to make a new kerfing saw blade. Will use the offcut from the last one. It's too short (the original was cut down from a piece bought for the bowsaw which is slightly less than double the blade length of the kerfing saw) This hopefully wont make much difference.
Apr 25, 2021 No sawing today, but started cutting the teeth for the new kerfing saw blade. This one will have a less aggressive angle (12degrees instead of 0degrees) to see if that makes it easier to push. I will also give it a little more set when I get to that stage.
Apr 26, 2021 Completed the new blade for the kerfing saw.
Apr 27, 2021 New blade cuts a lot easier. I think it is because there is more set (possibly a little too much, the kerf is visible on the completed plank) I suspect the old blade will work ok, and be a little faster, just given a bit more set.
Apr 28, 2021 Cut 2 drawer bottom planks. Not actually much faster, but easier going. Using longer reps (100+) and no noticeable decrease in accuracy.
Apr 29, 2021 Sharpened jack and try planes, and prepared the surfaces of the pieces cut for the last 4 drawer bottom pieces. Sawed the 8th piece, still almost 30 mins (2.9 sqin/min)
Apr 30, 2021 Cut the last pieces for the drawer bottoms.
May 3,  2021 Made a bench-stop for use when resawing. Prepared stock for the lip of the top drawer.
May 4,  2021 Fitted the lip around the top drawer.
May 5,  2021 Cleaned up the top drawer and sanded and oiled it. Improved the small file rack.
May 6,  2021 Made a bench stop plate to help with using the cutting gauge to slice strips.
May 7,  2021 Cut strip for edge of second drawer.
May 8,  2021 Cut rebate and glued edge strip on second drawer.
May 9,  2021 Finished second drawer front. Not sure I like the protruding strip. May reduce it, or flatten it completely next time the drawer is out.
May 10, 2021 Prepped stock for the 3rd drawer, Face sides and thickness.
May 11, 2021 Cut stock for the 3rd drawer to width. Cut the tails for the 4 corner joints.
May 12, 2021 Cut and fitted the back 2 sets of dovetail joints. Started on one of the front ones, and prepped the stock for the muntin.
May 13, 2021 Fitted the remaining dovetails of the 3rd drawer. Cut the grooves for the bottom. Prepared and glued up the drawer bottoms
May 14, 2021 Power cut for almost the whole day, but I did manage to flatten the surface of the drawer bottoms.
May 15, 2021 Fitted the bottom panels and the muntin. Didn't glue it yet, I want to add the edging strip first. It should be easier before the drawer is assembled.
May 16, 2021 Added the edging strip. Was restrained and didn't try to glue the rest up.
May 17, 2021 Cleaned up the edging strip and glued up the 3rd drawer.
May 18, 2021 Cleaned up the 3rd drawer.
May 19, 2021 Cut first support for 3rd drawer. Put my back out cleaning up, just by standing up.
May 24, 2021 Cut a small square for drawing pentagrams.
May 25, 2021 Cut some more squares. Drawing pentagons and pentagrams is best done with both 18-72 and 36-54 degree squares.
May 29, 2021 Started on wrapping the cords for the first manrope knot.
May 30, 2021 Completed the first manrope knot for the chest beckets.
Jun 6,  2021 Forgot to complete this diary. Last few days have been occupied with knot tying, but not sure what happened when.
Jun 7,  2021 coachwhipping for the hand grip of the becket. Ouch.
Jun 8,  2021 Completed the coachwhipping on the first becket.
Jun 9,  2021 Added the turks heads to the first becket. 16 cords * 24in (12 per leg) plus one longer one for the odd leg and the spiral cord for the stems, 16? cords * 48 for the coachwhipping (24 per leg), 16ft single cord for the large turks heads, I think the small ones were 5ft.
Jun 10, 2021 Cut a piece for the becket block. Started to prep it.
Jun 11, 2021 Drilled the hole for the becket. Pilot hole on the drill press, then first 1/2in with the adjustable bit. Rest with the adjustable bit with the adjustable cutter removed. Tendency to jam, so cleared the sides regularly with the carpenters gouges. Also removed some of the waste with further use of the drill press, being careful to maintain the centre hole to guide and draw in the bit. Cut the leather sheath and sewed it. Also made the washers.
Jun 12, 2021 Finished shaping the becket block. Cut the denim wrapping for the final manrope knot and started sewing it on.
Jun 13, 2021 Completed the 1st becket.
Jun 14, 2021 Attached the becket to the chest.
Jun 15, 2021 Cut the second support for the 3rd drawer and started to fit it.
Jun 16, 2021 Made support blocks for the 3rd drawer support.
Jun 17, 2021 Finished fitting the drawer supports and oiled the first 3 drawers again.

Jun 23, 2021 Prepared stock for drawer ends. cut to thickness.
Jun 24, 2021 Cut the 2 drawer ends to size. Started marking out dovetails
Jun 25, 2021 Completed marking out the dovetails.
Jun 26, 2021 Sawed the dovetails for the last drawer. This is going slowly. If I counted right this takes the total number of dovetails in the toolchest up to 164.
Jun 27, 2021 Cleaned up all the tails for the 4 joints.
Jun 28, 2021 Marked out the pins. Also made a left handed marking knife.
Jun 29, 2021 Cut all the pins and fitted the 2 front joints.
Jun 30, 2021 Fitted the remaining joints.
Jul 1,  2021 Made the bottom panels for the 4th drawer.
Jul 2,  2021 Fitted all the panels for the 4th drawer.
Jul 3,  2021 Glued and assembled the 4th drawer.
Jul 4,  2021 Cleaned up the 4th drawer and adjusted the fit. Started to make the runners.
Jul 5,  2021 Abandoned the first attempt at runners. There isn't enough width in the 3rd drawer supports to securely attach the 4th drawer runners.
Jul 6,  2021 Completed one new runner.
Jul 7,  2021 Fitted the first of the new runners and made the second.
Jul 8,  2021 fitted the second runner.

Jul 17, 2021 Made and fitted the handles for the top drawer and started thinking about storage at the front of the chest for saws.
Jul 18, 2021 Started making holster for 2 small saws.
Jul 19, 2021 Fitted saw holster.
Jul 23, 2021 Made and fitted the piece for the front of the toolchest that supports the 2 squares and will guard the framesaw. Started to make a holster for the marking knife
Jul 24, 2021 Fitted the marking knife holster. Glued up the square support. added the lip, and screwed it in place.
Jul 25, 2021 Made the grooved piece for the big rip-saw till.

Jul 27, 2021 Made till for crosscut and rip saws.
Jul 28, 2021 Fitted till for crosscut and rip saws. Toolchest is now fully operational, although the panels are still loose in the lid and it is missing one of the beckets.
Jul 29, 2021 Planing lathe build.
Jul 30, 2021 Cut pieces for lathe bedways.
Jul 31, 2021 Sharpened one of the Japanese style plane irons from the scrapyard for a new high angle plane. Lathe bedways are too hard to easily work with the usual planes.
Aug 1,  2021 Started making new handle for my toothing plane. Fitted it, but not chamfered and rounded the grip yet.
Aug 2,  2021 Completed and fitted the new handle for the toothing plane. Marked out piece to cut for the new high angle plane body. Not the mouth etc, only the crosscut. Cutting it at a slight angle as the body will not run parallel to the original sides of the beam so it follows the grain better.
Aug 3,  2021 Cut the piece for the body of the high angle plane. Handle of toothing plane was coming loose whenever I removed the blade so I glued it in. Prepared the face side at some cost. This stuff is very hard.
Aug 5,  2021 Prepared face edge of high angle plane body. Toothing plane is working nicely and new handle is now secure. Marked out bed and mouth.
Aug 6,  2021 Drilled and rough cut the mouth of the high angle jack plane.
Aug 7,  2021 Cleaned up the mouth and rough fitted the blade with temporary wedges. Cuts very nicely, although it jams quickly because the  mouth still needs refinement.
Aug 8,  2021 Made the wedge and refined the mouth. Cuts very well and made short work of planing the offcut from its body.
Aug 9,  2021 Cut out the tote for the high angle jack plane, including sawing to thickness with the kerfing plane and big rip, plus drill and coping saw followed by spokeshave.
Aug 10, 2021 Shaped and fitted the tote, cleaned up the top surface of the high angle jack plane body.
Aug 11, 2021 Finished off the high angle jack plane. Added chamfers and cleaned up all the surfaces. glued in the handle. Sanded some more and oiled it.
Aug 12, 2021 Prepared the face side of one of the lathe bedways. Started to work on the face edge. New plane is working well although it still needs to be sharpened frequently. Pretty sure that is just because of the extreme hardness of the timber.
Aug 13, 2021 Bit more work on the face edge, but back was hurting so I didn't push it. Cleaned up the toothing plane handle, and oiled it, and the new plane (with Pony's help)
Aug 14, 2021 Nailed in the edging strips in the toolchest lid.
Aug 15, 2021 Drawing plans for the frame joints of the lathe.
Aug 16, 2021 Decided to use the opposite face of the lathe bedways as the face side to maximize the amount of the heart that gets kept. Started truing that up. Multiple sharpenings, lots of adjusting practice. I think the trick to dealing with ultra hard woods is being able to resharpen quickly and efficiently. Showed Pony how to feel for a burr when sharpening, and how to look along a plane to see the set, or a piece to see the curve..
Aug 17, 2021 Taking it easy today. Showed Pen how to mark out the stock for her dolls house bed.
Aug 18, 2021 Back to trying to prep the stock for the bedways of the lathe. 5 cuts and the plane loses its edge. About 20 and it wont cut any more. Got the new face side done and started on the edge. Using the toothing plane as well now. The edge lasts a bit longer but still not all that long.
Aug 19, 2021 Completed face edge and marked out the thickness. 1/8 - 3/16 to remove from one end. Not sure whether to use the kerfing-plane (or plough plane) followed by a large gouge or use the scrub plane. It probably doesn't warrant the adze.
Aug 20, 2021 Roughed the first bedway to thickness with the scrub plane. Cuts well into the sapwood, but struggles with the heartwood as expected. Finished it off with the toothing plane. Modified the toothing plane handle. It's not as pretty but seems more comfortable now.
Aug 22, 2021 Made and fitted supports for the T-square in the tool chest.
Aug 23, 2021 More work on the first bedway face side and edge. Pretty close now.
Aug 24, 2021 Started on the second bedway. Got the face side roughly flat and started on the face edge.
Aug 25, 2021 More work on the face edge. It was quite curved, needed to remove about 1/4inch. Used the adzes.
Aug 28, 2021 More work on the face side. There is still a slight twist but its close to done.
Aug 29, 2021 Started work on making Bergeron readable. The English translation only covers volume 1 so I'm attempting to translate the French using the fulltext from archive.org and google translate. This is going to take a while. The OCR is good but there is a lot of crap in there that needs to be removed and formatted sensibly. Using org to assist this.
Aug 31, 2021 More work on the face side and edge of the second lathe bedway. Face is close enough now, started cutting the kerf to saw it to width. Cut a new piece (1inch thick) for the kerfing saw so I can use it to cut the bedways to depth. Still need to finish it. Rearranged the bottom layer of the toolchest so the kerfing saw can be accessible, and put away when it is set to a large width. Now most of the planes run front to back and the kerfing plane lives in front of the carving tools box.
Sep 1,  2021 Finished the kerf and started sawing. Painfully slow and constantly sticking. Started sharpening the saw (big rip) and ended up reshaping the teeth to have a bit less of an aggressive angle.
Sep 2,  2021 Finished sharpening the saw and completed the cut. The saw didn't need resetting. Much easier when it's sharp. Not sure if the less aggressive angle has made much difference. I suspect the cut is slightly slower, but easier and more predictable. That's a combination of guesswork, wishful thinking, and maybe the tiniest bit of unmeasurable feel. Whatever. It's working well, even in this extremely hard wood.
Sep 6,  2021 Sharpened both spokeshaves. Also managed to wear away my r.middle finger nail. I keep forgetting abrasives can do this...
Sep 8,  2021 More work on cleaning up the raw text for the Bergeron book.
Sep 14, 2021 Flattened the newly sawn face of the back bedway. This will be the final face side, and the internal edge of the bedway slot.
Sep 16, 2021 finished preparing the final face sides and edges for the bedways. Used the high angle jack.I can sharpen and set it a lot quicker now. Also getting in to the habit of sharpening it before putting it away. Makes starting off the next day much easier. Also started cutting the kerf for the depth cut on the back bedway. It's too close to the edge to saw but will serve as a guideline for using the scrub plane..
Sep 17, 2021 Started cutting the kerf for the depth cut on the front bedway. Hard going. The kerfing plane does a good job, but it often seems to be a bit of a fight. Maybe that is why there is no evidence of them being used historically. They can compensate for a lack of skill in rip sawing accurately, but maybe the best way is just to practice.
Sep 18, 2021 Cut the kerf a little deeper but not to full depth. The saw is way easier to use. Cut the excess off. Tried the high angle jack plane out on a 2in square section piece with wild grain. Very little tearout is visible. There is still some, but nothing that would cause a problem.
Sep 25, 2021 Planed the last edge of the bedways. Ready to start building the frame now.
Sep 28, 2021 Started to sort out stock for the lathe frame. Nothing cut yet, I need to decide if I should use the thicker piece for the 2 front uprights. There is just enough, but then it doesn't match at the bottom end, so it will need shaping. It's either that or have less thickness for the bedway Holtzapffel dovetail joints. Both options are possible.
Oct 1,  2021 Cut and started to prep the first upright.
Oct 2,  2021 Face side and face edge of the first upright done.
Oct 3,  2021 Prepared face side and edge of second front upright.
Oct 4,  2021 Started prep of first lower horizontal, Not good, worm damage. will need to redo.
Oct 6,  2021 Cut up some more beams for the lathe frame.
Oct 7,  2021 Rough prep of face and side of 1st back upright.
Oct 9,  2021 Finished face side and edge of first back upright.
Oct 11, 2021 Cut various pieces to length.
Oct 12, 2021 Prepped the first top piece and cut to length. Now have all the main pieces for one end frame and most of the other.
Oct 17, 2021 Lost track a bit. Slow work and missed days. At some point over the last few days, got the top right piece planed up on all four sides and 2 of the extra ½in pieces for the top of the front uprights sawn and surfaced.
Oct 19, 2021 Marked out and drilled the first mortice for the right hand frame of the lathe.
Oct 20, 2021 Cleaned up mortice slot in the front right upright, and the extra piece that goes on the back.
Oct 21, 2021 Made up a new batch of glue and glued the extra piece on the back of the right front upright.
Oct 25, 2021 cleaned up the edges of the glued on piece and cleaned up the mortice a bit. Slow today, feeling dizzy still.
Oct 28, 2021 Printed out Plumier (English translation) and started sewing it.
Oct 29, 2021 Finished sewing Plumier and glued it. Attempting to do it in one go this time. Turns out to be a mistake. Not easy to get the cover square and close fitting without gluing the book blank first.
Oct 30, 2021 Cut the edges of the Plumier book.
Nov 1,  2021 Cut the tenon on the top right horizontal. Replaced the rope work for one of the hammock chair bar supports. Tried to test it with the hook directly on the door frame beam. Schoolboy error.. Hook is strong enough when the strain is on the curve of the s as in normal use, but the point is much further out and the hook straightened out, dumping me on the floor. Bruised toe and a ding in my forehead where the hook hit me. Nhâm over-reacted as predicted (:-)
Nov 2,  2021 Finished the new ropework for the hammock chair bar. Chin-ups are hard now. Will take time to get back to the point where I can do 10 in a row.
Nov 9,  2021 Worked on fitting the first mortice and tenon joint of the lathe. Not quite there, slides in about half way.
Nov 11, 2021 Completed fitting the first M and T joint.
Nov 13, 2021 Started flattening the top surface of the right front upright of the lathe frame.
Nov 14, 2021 Finished flattening the top surface of the right upright and started marking it out for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 15, 2021 Roughed out the separator slot for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 17, 2021 Cleaned up the separator slot
Nov 18, 2021 Roughed out the first sloping face of the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 19, 2021 Roughed out the second sloping face for the Holtzapffel dovetail.
Nov 22, 2021 Made a shelf for the cookbooks. Used the broken handle from the toothing plane as a bookend.
Nov 25, 2021 made and rough fitted the separator piece for the first Holtzapffel dovetail. Not driven it all the way in yet, it would be hard to get it out again. Marked the ends of the bedways to match the joint.
Nov 26, 2021 Cut the ends of he bedways. Managed to saw fairly accurately, essential because this stuff is a pig to plane.
Nov 27, 2021 Planed the ends of the bedways. Started to plan making a chamfer/bullnose plane to help finish the matching surfaces.
Dec 11, 2021 Made a chisel plane.
Dec 11, 2021 Chisel plane is not much use on this wood. Reverted to chisel, scraper chisel and abrasive.
Dec 21, 2021 Prepped face side and edge of the second back upright.
Dec 22, 2021 Finished the second large cusion for the hammock chair. Should have done this years ago...
Dec 25, 2021 Bought a metal turning lathe, and started to clean it up. Dismantled the cross slide and reasssembled it.
Dec 26, 2021 dismantled and reassembled the top slide. Recut some of the threads on the toolpost which have seen some abuse. The handwheel on the top slide had the wrong screw holding the wheel with the graduations in place. The threads are a different pitch from usual, so although the replacement screw was the correct size (6mm) it had messed up the threads. I redrilled it and cut a thread the next size up as I had an allen headed screw of the right size. The head was too wide so I used the lathe to turn it down to roughly match the original on the other handwheel. 2 different sized screws turned by the same allen key now. 
Dec 27, 2021 Finished cleaning up the threads in the toolpost. They are all ok now, although there aren't enough bolts for all of them. 2 of the tapped holes had pieces of broken bolt in them. The first came out yesterday, pushed by the tap (I didn't realise it was there) The second I drilled as close as I could get to the correct tapping size then cut the remains out with the tap. The taps I have are a cheap set but they seem to be holding up well. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the tap driver which appears to be made of cheese. Wish I could find the old tap driver I had. Simple square holes in a hardened steel bar are far more sensible than a fancy adjusting mechanism with left and right hand threads.
Dec 29, 2021 Drilled the mortice for the top back right joint of the lathe frame. Started cutting the matching tenon.
Dec 31, 2021 Cut the mortice to approximate size. Still a bit of cleanup on the crossgrain faces to do.
Jan 1,  2022 Cut the tenon for the top back right corner of the lathe frame. Also resharpened the stanley crosscut saw as a rip saw. Cuts very nicely, ideal for mid sized stuff.
Jan 3,  2022 Cut a piece for the guitar.
Jan 4,  2022 Further shaping of the guitar piece. Cut some brass tube for the spacers and fitted it. It's now playable.
Jan 7,  2022 Cut the haunch and fitted the back right mortice and tenon joint.
Jan 8,  2022 Refined the fitting of the 2 mortice and tenon joints
Jan 9,  2022 Sewed and glued SICP
Jan 10, 2022 Cut SICP. Biggest book yet.
Jan 12, 2022 More cleaning up of the top mortice and tenons for the right hand frame of the lathe. Now I can't get thin clock spring poker in between the parts of the joint on the outside face. There is a tiny bit on the inside that isn't completely closed yet, but that's probably ok. Marked out the bottom mortice and tenons.
Jan 15, 2022 Tailstock arrived, converted it to allen keys. Considering the best way to cut it to shorten it. Might be worth buying an end mill to use in the metal lathe. Might just file (scrape?) it.
Jan 17, 2022 Drilled mortices for the bottom of the lathe side frame.
Jan 19, 2022 Started to chop the mortices.
Feb 5,  2022 Rough fitted the floyd rose. Will need to take the top surface back, but it fits ok and seems to be reasonably well intonated with the old posts. Might not have to move them forwards but may still move them outwards a little.
Mar 19, 2022 Started cutting the front surface back so the floyd is level with it not recessed.
Mar 20, 2022 Plugged and re-drilled one of the bridge pivot holes. Did some more shaping, reducing the bulge behind the nut, the recess for the bridge and the heel.
Mar 21, 2022 More reshaping. Refined the heel some more. Restrung it to check how the bridge sits now.
Mar 22, 2022 Deepened the pickup recess to accomodate the reduction of depth caused by cutting back the front surface.
Mar 23, 2022 Glued a plug into the hole left for inserting the truss rod.
Mar 24, 2022 Made clearance for the trem and started sanding.
Mar 25, 2022 More sanding and oiled the body
Mar 26, 2022 Sanded the top bar, oiled, assembled and tested.
Mar 29, 2022 Cut the tenon at the bottom of the right front leg of the lathe. Reground Les's 78 to useon the tenon faces. Tried setting up the edge plane too. It's not as hard as I thought it would be. Also worked on the end grain faces of the mortice that matches the tenon.
Apr 1,  2022 Fitted the bottom front right joint and cut the haunch on the bottom back right tenon.
Apr 3,  2022 Made and fitted the locking nut for my guitar. Spent some time trying to get the strap length right. Tricky because of the offset strap button. If it's short enough to have a relaxed right arm then it tends to tilt the body, which makes it easier to see the fretboard but not good for the left wrist.
Apr 5,  2022 Fitted all 4 mortice and tenon joints, and assembled the right hand frame.
Apr 6,  2022 Refined the 4 joints so the shoulders all meet reasonably well.
Apr 7,  2022 Mostly thinking about how to do the motor mount and the groove for the backboard of the lathe.
Apr 8,  2022 Cut the groove in the top horizontal piece, and the curve on the front of the foot. Not going to glue it up just yet, probably better to get both sides made first. Retired the old rip saw. The widthwise bow is too much trouble. Put the handle on the new stanley crosscut sharpened as a rip. Resharpened all the new metric drills.
Apr 11, 2022 Cut a piece to make the extensions at the top of the lathe left leg.
Apr 12, 2022 Sharpened the high angle jack and the try plane and finished squaring off the front left upright. Continued with marking it out. The bottom tenon was already marked when figuring out how to avoid the holes in the piece.
Apr 13, 2022 Set up new camera mouint on the window in to the workshop. Discovered I have an old tap that is the right size for a camera mounting bolt.
Apr 15, 2022 Trued up the extra piece, cut it to width and length and glued it on to the top of the leg.
Apr 16, 2022 Refined the face side (including the added piece) and face edge. Marked out the top mortice and adjusted the bottom tenon which was already marked, but too short. I had marked it as just long enough to clear the bolt hole, but it turns out there was more spare length at the top end. I can now leave the bottom piece at full width and add feet rather than cut it to shape if I choose.
Apr 18, 2022 Started truing up the horizontal piece. Videoed it, but didn't talk, just as a dry run. High angle plane is jamming. Going to try and sort that before the next take.
Apr 19, 2022 Finished truing up the top horizontal piece. Cut it to width and thickness. Did some fettling of the high angle plane. Still not quite right but getting better.
Apr 20, 2022 Marked out the horizontal piece and cut it to length. Drilled and chopped the mortice for the top left front joint of the frame.
Apr 21, 2022 Drilled and chopped the mortice for the top back left joint of the lathe frame.
Apr 22, 2022 Cleaned up the 2 mortices.
Apr 23, 2022 Marked and cut the tenons on the top left horizontal piece of the lathe frame.
Apr 24, 2022 Cleaned up both tenons
Apr 25, 2022 Cut the haunch on the front tenon and fitted the joint. Sharpened and set the infill shoulder plane. Really tricky to do, the end of the blade needs to be at exactly the right angle, which isn't exactly 90° as far as I can tell. Also there is a slight rounding on one side of the mouth that makes it look like it is wider on one side. That confuses the issue a bit. Best ignore how wide the mouth looks and just sight along the sole to see how much the blade protrudes.
Apr 26, 2022 Glued on the second extra piece of the front left lathe leg.
Apr 27, 2022 Cut the mortice for yhe lathe bed spacers and marked out all parts of the Holtzapffel dovetail joint. Opened up the mouth of the high angle jack plane a bit more, and cambered the iron a little. It seems to cut without clogging now.
Apr 28, 2022 Sharpened the tenon saw. Seems to be ok for set still. Not looking forward to having to set it. Cut the rest of the second Hotzapffel dovetail on the upright and marked out the matching ends on the bedways.
Apr 29, 2022 Cut the end of the bedways. Brought the drill press inside and mounted it on the bench. Started drilling the first lengthwize hole in one of the bedways.
Apr 30, 2022 Fixed the chuck on the non ratchet brace. One of the jaws had got badly twisted. Completed drilling the lengthwise holes in the bedways and took the drill press back outside again
May 1,  2022 Brought another length of wood in and cut it for the lower part of the left hand lathe frame. Washed it down to get rid of some of the dirt.
May 2,  2022 Trued up The piece I cut for the lower left lathe frame
May 3,  2022 Marked up the remaining joints for the left side lathe frame and drilled the 2 mortices. Started chopping out the front one.
May 4,  2022 Cleaned up the front mortice and started chopping the second. Also got the bike running again, adjusted the brakes and cleaned and oiled the chain.
May 5,  2022 Cut the tenons for the last 2 joints
May 6,  2022 Cut the haunches. Rough fitted all 4 joints. They go together but not all the way home yet.
May 7,  2022 Adjusted the fit of all 4 mortice and tenons. Sawed the taper on the front upright.
May 8,  2022 Shaped the mouldings at the top of the front leg, added the radius on the left foot and cleaned up the taper on the left front leg.
May 9,  2022 Glued the 2 frames together. Used Spanish windlass to clamp it and they aren't really fast enough (or I'm not fast enough), left with some tiny gaps. I should have taken the time out to build some sash cramps.
May 10, 2022 Cleaned up the 2 frames.
May 12, 2022 Went looking for metal to make the big square nuts to embed in the lathe parts. Ended up at Tuan's shop to see if he knew where to go and came away with some offcuts that will do the job nicely. Also found out he can cast iron which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
May 13, 2022 Made the first nut. Tapping it was difficult, I think the hole was a fraction too small for the tap. Thread came out well though. Cut the recess for the first nut and fitted it.
May 14, 2022 Marked out the remaining 7 square nuts and drilled and tapped them. Used a 1/2inch drill as recommended on the chart. Tapped easier, but the threads are not as deep, there is a visible flat on the top. Willinvestigate using a 12mm drill and a taper tap when I can get them.
May 15, 2022 Fitted the first of the bedway separator pieces and cut and fit the second.
May 16, 2022 Clamped the 2 side frames together and planed the bottom so the top surfaces are level. Visited Tuan to get the remaining 7 nuts cut out. Staightened the bolts and marked out the other 3 slots in the bedways.
May 17, 2022 Drilled the slots for the remaining 3 nuts and chiseled out the first of them and fitted the nut.
May 18, 2022 Fitted the remaining nuts and assembled the bedways. 
May 19, 2022 Started refining the fit of the Holtzapffel dovetails using carbon paper and a scraper chisel.
May 24, 2022 Did some more work on the Holtzapffel dovetails on the left hand end of the bedways. got them roughly right and started to work on the right hand end ones. Not going to push it too far, don't want to retrigger my bad back. Lifting the 15/16 kg frames on and off the bench is risky.
May 25, 2022 Completed the fitting of the Holtzapffel dovetails.
May 27, 2022 Started to prep the top back horizontal for the lathe. Got the face side and face edge done and started on the thickness. Ordered the flywheel shaft and bearings and the headstock/tailstock shaft.
May 28, 2022 Finished preping the back piece and marked the tenons.
May 29, 2022 Cut the tenons.
May 30, 2022 Drilled the mortices and cut them.
May 31, 2022 Drilled the nut mortices and cut the first one.
Jun 1,  2022 Cut the second nut mortice. Fitted the nuts and bolted the back piece in. Moved the drill press back outside.
Jun 2,  2022 Cut the groove in the back horizontal piece.
Jun 3,  2022 Cut 2 pieces (and cleaned off the dirt with a hosepipe) for the motor mount bar and the lower back horizontal
Jun 4,  2022 Started prepping the motor mount bar. Put my back out turning while sitting on the saw horse. Was reaching for the try-plane to put the blade back in after sharpening. There was a very slight twinge earlier. Must learn to listen to those.
Jun 13, 2022 Finished squaring off the motor mount piece. Had to fettle the top iron of the try plane. Shavings were going straight under it. Putting a burr on it fixed it. This plane is always difficult to adjust, I don't know why. Maybe I drive the wedge in too hard, it might not be necessary.
Jun 14, 2022 Cut the tenon on the motor mount and fitted it
Jun 15, 2022 Drilled the hole for the rear bolt on the motor mount and drilled and cut the tenon for the nut. Drilled the hole for the front mount and made a spacer. Marked the position of the matching hole in the side frame.
Jun 16, 2022 Drilled the hole in the side frame for the motor mount. Remade the spacer. Fitted the motor mount bar.
Jun 18, 2022 Went to visit Tuan and get some more square nut blanks cut. Met Tu, and got a demo of the new laser cutter machine they had put together.
Jun 19, 2022 Tipped the lathe onto it's back and started to clean up the front surface. Back twinge so I gave up. Might have caught it early enough this time.
Jun 21, 2022 Smoothed out the front face of the front bedway and stood the lathe up again very carefully.
Jun 22, 2022 Prepared face side and face edge on the bottom horizontal piece. Concentrating on controlled movements. This is tricky, momentum can help start a heavy cut and it's not possible to know just how much force a given cut will take until it starts actually cutting. Ordered a flywheel and a temporary pulley, plus some flanges that may do for the headstock pulley boss and faceplates. 
Jun 23, 2022 Reduced bottom hotizontal piece to width and thickness, marked out the length.
Jun 24, 2022 Cut the bottom hrizontal piece to length and marked out and cut the tenons. Sunk the nut on the front of the motor mount piece.
Jun 25, 2022 Setup camera and photographed the pages of the first of Grandma's photo albums.
Jun 26, 2022 Drilled the mortices for the bottom back bar and chopped the first one.
Jun 27, 2022 Chopped the second mortice for the bottom back bar.
Jun 28, 2022 Drilled the holes in the side frame for the back bar bolts by hand. Marked the position of the longitudonal holes in the back bar. Brought the drill press in and set it up and drilled the holes. Took the drill back outside again.  
Jun 29, 2022 Cut the nut mortices and fitted the bottom back bar.
Jun 30, 2022 Reviewed state of Steve's mobile and started looking for some pieces to make the remaining planets and moons.
Jul 2,  2022 Cut out a new version of Saturn for Steve's mobile. Also Neptune, but that broke when trilling it for the hanging thread. Added threads to the sun, mercury, venus, jupiter and saturn. Made a new drill to make the holes, from a fine needle (24thou or thereaboouts).
Jul 3,  2022 Photographed one of Grandma's photo albums and made a pdf version.
Jul 5, 2022 Made mars, earth and a new neptune.
Jul 6, 2022 Tries to make some moons from the shell disks from some kind of sea snail. Drilling was not successful and trying to use the grinder to create a disc with a view to turning a groove in the edge to take the thread was also unsucessfull.
